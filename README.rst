Grimhaven MUD
=============

This is the source code to the Grimhaven MUD server. It is derived from the SneezyMUD 5.2
source code and game data release. It is tested on Debian GNU/Linux, but will probably
build and run on any Unix-like system meeting the prerequisites.

Building
========

You will need the following available to build:

* Unix-like system
* C++ compiler (tested with gcc 4.7)
* scons build tool (tested with 2.2.0 on Python 2.7)
* SQLite 3 (tested with 3.7.13)
* c-ares (tested with 1.9.1)
* Boost C++ libraries (tested with v1.50), specifically the following modules:
  * date-time
  * program-options
  * regex
  * serialization

Once these are met, simply run the `scons` command in this directory.

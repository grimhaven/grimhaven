say { "hello";
      tovict $n grunts at you and goes back to work.;
      tonotvict $n grunts at %n and then goes back to work.;
}

say { "dragon armor";
      tovict $n looks up from his work.;
      tonotvict $n looks up from his work.;
      say Aye, I know the secrets of dragon armor construction.;
      say Why are you asking me?  I've got no <c>interest<1> in helping one of you surface dwellers.;
}

say { "interest";
      say Well...;
      say I suppose if you could make it <c>worth<1> my while, I could construct a suit of dragon armor for you.;
      say But you'd have to be bringing me the necessary <c>supplies<1> mind you!;
      say When you have brought me <c>everything<1>, just ask me to <c>make the armor<1> and I will do so.;
      say When I finish the armor it will be attuned to you only and no one else will be able to wear it.;
      say And of course it wouldn't be appropriate for mages, thieves, shamans or monks.;
}

say { "everything";
      say I need the following things:;
      say 250,000 talens.;
      say A malachite warhammer.;
      say Some illithid sinew.;
      say Red, white or green dragon scales.;
      say A bag of sulpher, a cylinder of liquid frost or a vial of acid.;
      say A huge opal.;
      say A suit of tungsten armor.;
      say Five vials of powdered dragon bone.;
}


say { "worth";
      say First, I want no less than 250,000 talens.  More if you can spare it!;
      say Second, I need you to find for me a particular <c>warhammer<1>.;
}

say { "warhammer";
      say It's a hammer carved from a single block of malachite.;
      say I'm not terribly familiar with this malachite material and I'm curious to test it's properties.;
      say A surfaced dwarf by the name of Dakinor is in the custom of carrying these.;
      say I suggest you smite him.;
}

say { "supplies";
      say There are three main components to creating a suit of dragon armor.;
      say The <c>body<1> of the suit, the <c>thread<1> and the <c>focusing<1> of magic while I construct the suit.;
}

say { "body";
      say I can create either red, white or green dragon armor.;
      say Each type of armor carries the properties of the type of dragon it is made of.;
      say There are three dragons that I know of, any of which would be appropriate.;
      say Shracknir is a green dragon, who dwells in a forest.  She breathes acid and armor made from her scales would carry protection from acid.;
      say Tidas is a red dragon, who dwells at sea.  He breathes fire and armor made from his scales would carry protection from heat.;
      say Kylish'Ra is a white dragon, who dwells deep in a cave, although far from here.  She breathes frost and her armor would protect from cold.;
      say In addition to a pile of scales from any of these three dragons I would need to construct a frame.;
      say The frame must be suitably strong.  Tungsten would be an excellent choice.;
      say Yes, bring me a suit of tungsten armor to use as the frame.;
      say Don't worry - I will resize the suit to fit you.;
}

say { "thread";
      say The thread I use to create this armor can not be any ordinary thread.;
      say It must be incredibly strong and resistant to elements, as well as highly magical.;
      say There is an illithid wizard in a cell not far from here.  He has outlived his usefulness, although the governor may disagree.;
      say Kill the illithid and cut the sinew from the body.  Illithid sinew makes an excellent magical thread.;
      say I will need to imbue the thread with the appropriate element.;
      say For green dragon armor I will need a vial of acid to prepare the thread.;
      say For red dragon armor, a bag of sulphur.;
      say For white dragon armor, only a cylinder of liquid frost will do.;
}

say { "focusing";
      say The magics required to create such a suit are mighty indeed.;
      say The scales themselves will attempt to rebel at enslavement, the spirit of a dragon is nothing to trifle with.;
      say I will need to prepare my tools with powdered dragon bone.  5 vials of it should suffice.;
      say A huge opal will also be required, so that I may focus the needed magical energies.;
      say I'm not a mage myself, which is why I require the opal.;
      say Very powerful mages tend to carry these, you may wish to search in the area known as 'Inverse Grimhaven'.;

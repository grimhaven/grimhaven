      say Ack!  I knew there was something I forgot to do.;
      say I was supposed to take a hoe out to the fields for someone.;
      say And now he sent you to get it from me?;
      say I'll bet he offered you something then.;
      say And probably something worth your wild to do such a mundane task.;
      grin;
      say What did he offer you?;

      say Sapphires eh?  Those sound nice, too bad they mean little to us.;
      say But I'm sure they are worth a good deal to you.;
      say Tell you what, I'll fetch a hoe for you if you want to <W>deal<1>.;
}

say {"deal";
      say Good!  What I'd like is a nice wool shirt.;
      say And not some cheap one.;
      say We had some travelers around here a while back.;
      say Were wearing some nice wool shirts.;
      say Said they got them from a workman in the Obsidian Citadel.;
      say Get me one of those and I'll get the hoe.;
      say Or I'll just take it out to him myself.;

say {"obsidian citadel";
      say I don't really know too much about the Obsidian Citadel.;
      say Travelers from west of the plains talk about it a little is all.;

       say This should fit nicely I'd think.;
       say Let me just run and put it away and grab a hoe for you.;
       toroom $n suddenly looks about noticing his surroundings.;
       say You know, I seem to have gotten myself lost somehow.;
       say I'm not really sure where I should get a hoe from.;
       say I guess I'd better give this back until I can complete our deal.;

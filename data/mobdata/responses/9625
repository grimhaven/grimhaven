  say Please, I beg of you, <c>help<1> me!;

say { "help";
  say Yes, I've been shackled here to this mast by Captain Bethem.;
  say Even in death I cannot escape!;
  say In life I was a missionary, a good man.;
  say But Bethem discovered the secret thing I possessed.;
  say He came for it, slaughtering everyone in the town where I built my missionary.;
  say But once on the ship, I was able to free myself in the night, steal it back, and hide it.;
  say They caught me shortly after and chained me to this mast, but I refuse to give up my <c>secret<1>!;
}

say { "secret";
  say I will tell you, if you promise to help me.;
  say You must free me, so I can escape from this wretched place.;
  say Once that is done, I will tell you where I have hidden the thing and you must retrieve it and keep it from Bethem.;
  say Will you help me?;
}

say { "yes";
  say Alright.  You must never tell anyone of this...;
  say What Captain Bethem took from me is the very heart of a fallen angel.;
  say The angel fell from heaven, dead, onto my island.;
  say I tore the heart out and then burned the body using the proper rites of the elder gods.;
  say The heart of an angel is a valuable thing and should never fall into the hands of mortals, much less someone as evil as Bethem!;
  say If you can free me, then I will tell you where the heart is hidden on this ship.;
  say You may take it to do as you please, as long as you keep it from Bethem and his evil crew.;
  say Now, to free me, you will need to find two <c>keys<1>.;
}

say { "keys";
  say There are two keys to these set of shackles, I need both of them to free myself.;
  say The first mate has one of the keys and the dread Captain Bethem himself has the other.;
  say Bring these keys to me.;
  say Do not be fooled, although you may smite the undead denizens of this ship, it would take more than that to be done with them forever.;
  say That is why it is so critical to rescue the angel heart!;
  say Please, go now and retrieve the keys!;
}

say { "Bethem";
  say The cruelest pirate in the seas!;
  say It is said that in life he was guided by the most vile of the elder gods and now I believe it to be true.;
}

say { "pewp";
  say don't be dumb dude;

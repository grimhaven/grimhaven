say { "mushrooms";
        say Yes, but these are not ordinary mushrooms, in the hands of an accomplished shaman,;
        say these fungi can be a lethal weapon.;
	toroom $n shakes the swollen orb above her hand, and a few spores float into her palm.;
	say Ahhh, ripened to perfection, this shroom will give quite the 'buzz'.;

	say If you feel the need, I have a few that I might be able to part with for the right <r>price<1>.;

        toroom $n reaches into her basket and pulls out a large swollen mushroom.;
	toroom $n gives the mushroom a few flicks, dislodging a generous amount of spores.;
	toroom $n rams her finger into her ear, pulling out a large chunk of earwax.;
	giggle;
	say Ahhh, 10 pounds lighter...;
	toroom $n rolls the spores into the earwax, creating a neat little ball.;
        give spore %n;
        say There ya be, enjoy the shrooms.;

        toroom $n promptly begins to ignore you.;

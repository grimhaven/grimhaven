# Notes : 
#   Quest can only be done once per character.  Hence the final 
# settoggle. I'm not sure if this 
# is possible to setup this way.  I don't want people to be able 
# to do this quest more then once.
# and I want the quest mobs to respond differently to people who 
# have completed the quest.  To make
#   the story more believable.

      say Yes as a proper member of the clergy I of course have holy symbols.;
      say But mine were unfortunately damaged quite badly by fire.;
      say And I worry to use them for everyday use.;
      say I'm hoping to trade them for new ones soon.;
}

say {"trade";
      say You wish to trade?.;
      say I fear I have little, and need little.;
      say But if you were to bring me a new bronze holy symbol...;
      say I could trade you one of my damaged symbols.;
      say They are slighly weaker due to the fire damage, but...;
      say I have purified and affixed a simple necklace to them.;
      say Allows one to work and pray at the same time when they must.;

       say It seems I've become lost.;
       say Perhaps you should come back when I've better relocated myself.;

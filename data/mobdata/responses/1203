	say I see.  That's unfortunate.  We used to have this silly code of honor dictating that paladins must be victorious or die in battle.;
	say Obviously that was ridiculous, it's much better to surrender so we can organize a rescue.;
	say I always keep a close eye on any conflicts in case we need to send out a rescue team, but I guess there is no need in this case.;

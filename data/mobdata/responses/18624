say { "hello";
  say Hi there.  Have you come to <c>purchase<1> a bag?;
}

say { "purchase";
  say I create a number of magical containers, which you may buy!;
  say The finest of them is the <c>portable hole<1>.;
  say The <c>bag of holding<1> is smaller, but cheaper.;
  say I also make <c>travelling pack<1>s out of displacer beast guts,;
  say as well as magical <c>spellbag<1>s out of dragon guts.;
  say Are you interested in any of these?;
}

list { "";
  link say purchase;
}

say { "spellbag";
  say My spellbags are quite large and weightless like the other bags.;
  say They protect spell components quite well.;
  say They are the ultimate accessory for the demanding mage!;
  say I could sell you one for <W>#OBJCOST(18613, 10)#<1> talens.;
}

list { "spellbag";
  link say spellbag;
}

give { "-#OBJCOST(18613, 10)#";
  nod;
  load 18613;
  give dragon-spellbag %n;
}


say { "travelling pack";
  say My travelling packs use a basic form of displacement magic, to keep their contents in a state of flux.;
  say This makes the pack weightless.  The magic is limited however, and the packs are quite small.;
  say I could sell you one for <W>#OBJCOST(18614, 10)#<1> talens.;
}

list { "travelling pack";
  link say travelling pack;
}

give { "-#OBJCOST(18614, 10)#";
  nod;
  load 18614;
  give pack-displacer %n;
}


say { "bag of holding";
  say The bag of holding is similar to the portable hole, but works on a different principle.;
  say The bag leads to a shared mini-dimension, where physical objects occupy the same space.;
  say The interior of the bags of holding I make actually occupy the same mini-dimension.;
  say But you'd never know it - they appear entirely separate to the untrained eye.;
  say While the magic required to construct these is less powerful than the portable hole,;
  say it does mean that the mini-dimension these bags use is much smaller.;
  say As a result the bags of holding hold less, but are still weightless.;
  say I could sell you one for <W>#OBJCOST(13887, 10)#<1> talens.;
}

list { "bag of holding";
  link say bag of holding;
}

give { "-#OBJCOST(13887, 10)#";
  nod;
  load 13887;
  give bag-holding %n;
}

say { "portable hole";
  say Ah yes, my finest creation.;
  say The portable hole is actually a portal into a mini-dimension.;
  say Obviously, it can hold quite a lot and is nearly weightless.;
  say I could sell you one for <W>#OBJCOST(31888, 10)#<1> talens.;
}

list { "portable hole";
  link say portable hole;

give { "-#OBJCOST(31888, 10)#";

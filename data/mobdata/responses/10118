 say Can I help you?;
 say I must take my walk with Rangui soon.;
}

say {"Rangui";
 say Yes Rangui is seer of the Elven Village.;
 say We take walks daily to help keep his strength up.;
 say Sometimes we walk during the day...;
 say Other times late at night when he can't sleep.;
 say We see some of the prettiest wildlife on our walks.;
}

say {"wildlife";
 say Oh yes, the wildlife about the Village is amazing.;
 say I find the birds especially fascinating.;
 say I try to collect the feathers I find for decorations.;
}

say {"feather";
 say Yes I love to collect the feathers and decorate my small abode.;
 say I have quite an abundance of them now.;
 say Were you looking for any particular ones?;
 say Perhaps if you tell me the color and type of bird?;
}

say {"falcon";
 say Yes the falcon is a beautiful bird.;
 say I see many about the forest, although...;
 say they seem to remain well hidden.;
 say But my elven eyes and training help me..;
 say spot them easy enough.;
 say I especially like the Peregrine Falcons.;
}

say {"green falcon";
 say I don't recall any green falcons.;
 say Although the Peregrine Falcons sometimes have...;
 say a few miscolored feathers which appear green.;
 say I've found many of those feathers on our walks.;
 say Seems the bird tends to pluck them out on its own.;
 say I have several I found yesterday if you need some.;
 say They are excellent for mages to use in their spells.;
 say And I suppose I could use the talens.;
 say Rangui's medicines are quite expensive.;
 say How about #OBJCOST( 206, 20)# talens per feather?;
}

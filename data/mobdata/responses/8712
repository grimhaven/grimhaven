say { "hello";
  toroom $n looks up from a stack of travel brochures, startled by your entrance.;
  say Hello there.  Would you be interested in one of our many <c>tour<1> or <c>vacation<1> packages?;
  smile %n;
}


say { "vacation";
  say We have many great vacation packages to choose from.  You can purchase a 1 week cruise on the  beautiful Myrian Ocean or a safari on the Veldt.;
  toroom $n starts shuffling through brochures.;
  say Sorry.  I can't seem to find any of our vacation plans at this time.  Perhaps you would be interested in a <c>tour<1> package.;

say { "tour";
  say Yes, we pride ourselves on our tour programs.  Our number one tour package is of Historic Grimhaven.;
  say Of course, it is our only tour program at this time.;
  say We used to have regular tours of Brightmoon, but the increasing hostilities with <c>Logrus<1> put an end to that.;

say { "Logrus";
  toroom $n looks around nervously.;
  tell %n I could get in real trouble for this, so you can't breathe a word to anyone.  I can sell you a special <c>pass<1> that will let you enter the City of Logrus.;
}

say { "pass";
  toroom $n takes a quick glance out the window.;
  tell %n Yeah, I've got these laminated passes that can be used for safe passage through the City of Logrus.  I can sell you one for 5000 talens.;
  tell %n The Logrites won't honor it for Brothers of Galek however, only for Serpents.;

give { "-5000";
  say Right then, here you are.;

    say Brain Coral?;
    say What about it?  The ocean floor is covered in it....;
    say If you know where to look.;
    say My brother claims it has special properties...;
    say But I've yet to find any.;

    sigh;
    say I'd get you some...;
    say ...but unfortunately I seem to be lost.;
    say Perhaps if you visit me in my homeland sometime.;

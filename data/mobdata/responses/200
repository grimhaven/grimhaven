say { "dragonhide";
	checktoggle 158;
	chuckle;
	tell %n Do not worry, a fresh dragonhide will not work;
	tell %n So you will not be going dragon hunting anytime soon.;
	tell %n There is a man that wanders around the streets of Grimhaven though ;
	tell %n That probably owns something that will fit your needs.;
	tell %n Simply tell him that you need dragonhide.;
	tell %n It will be up to you to find him, but I can give you a hint.;
	}

say {"hint";
	checktoggle 158;

	toroom $n gestures about the room.;
	tell %n There should be some thread left in Grimhaven.;
	tell %n I have trouble keeping track of all the people who work here,;
	tell %n But I believe it was left with a very flighty personality.;
	}
  
say {"flighty";
	checktoggle 159;
	tell %n You will have to figure out who it is on your own.;
	tell %n But flighty seems to be the best way to describe her.;

  toroom $n drinks heartily of the water and wipes $s brow.;
  toroom Stooping down, $e picks up a stalk of wheat and holds it out before you.;
  say Do you see these seeds?  See how small they are?;
  say And yet these seeds feed all the Brotherhood.;
  say Each seed is equally important, for it feeds both the draft horse and the General.;
  say So, too, is every Brother in the Order.  Every individual is a seed.;
  say Alone, they are beaten upon the face of the land at the mercy of the winds.;
  say However, when united beside the stalk of Galek, we stand mighty as these fields, side-by-side, ready to sustain one another.;
  smile;
  toroom As $n plucks a seed from the stalk, it blows from his hand and flies gently southward, revealing a pathway through the wheat fields.;
  say Let it lead you my brother, and may you return with the wisdom of Elyon.;

say {"hello";
	frown;
	say Now what do you want?;
	say Can't you see I'm much too busy to be bothered?;
	say I must figure out a way to control the Obsidian man.;
	}

give {"10784";
	say I swear that man is a simpleton.;
	say Does he think I have time to bother with these trivial matters?;
	say I am too busy looking for some way to control the Obsidian Man.;
	say Now leave me be.;
	toroom $n drops the message in thin air and it vanishes.;
 	load 10785;
	toroom $n pulls something from where the message vanished.;
	toroom $n places a tiny object into his pocket and turns away.;
	}

say {"obsidian man";
	say The Obsidian Man?;
 	say Yes, his power is amazing, if only I can learn to harness it.;
	say There is an obsidian earring which is said can control him.;
	say But it keeps eluding me when I attempt to test its powers.;
	}

say {"obsidian earring";
	say Yes a small earring made of pure obsidian.;
	say Every time I get it, its magic draws it away from me.;
	say But I have some ideas how to stop it if I get it again.;
	say Would you help me locate it?;
	say I'll help you get what the Bishop seeks if you would.;
	say Just say you'll agree to help.;
	}

say {"bishop";
	say I assume you know all about Bishop Mercees latest plot.;
	say He seeks the King's Scepter in hopes of ruling the Citadel.;
	say Right now he is stuck in a joint ruler-ship with Valteez.;
	say While we are held in the Keep by the Obsidian Man's curse.;
	say But the Scepter would let him gain power over Valteez.;
	}

say {"agree to help";
	say Great!  OK all I can tell you is to seek out Overseer Talrog.;
	say He's in the Mines where the Obsidian Man was first unearthed.;
	say Maybe I have a bauble here I've been promising him.;
	say It might make him more cooperative.;
	give ring %n;
	}

say {"bauble";
	say Oh that, it's just a small ring for Talrog?;
	say Generally he is more cooperative when I give him gifts.;
	say But I'm not sure I can really trust you to deliver it.;
	say People have agreed before, then keep what I give them.;
	say Maybe if you had proven your trust to me before.;
	}

say {"trust";
	say I trust people once they've fulfilled a task given them.;
	say Many times the King sends message to me via adventurers.;
	say If I receive those I find I feel more at ease with the person.;
	say If you can prove yourself and still want to help let me know.;
	}

give {"7087";
	load 10786;
	say Ahh, you found it!  Here is my part of our bargain.;
	toroom $n reaches into thin air pulling out a small wax key.;
 	toroom $n drops the Obsidian Earring into thin air and it vanishes!;
  	say You'll find the Scepter in the Treasure Chamber below.;
	say The guard there should be able to open the appropriate chest.;
 	give key %n;
	cackle;

say { "story";
	toroom $n screeches madly.;
	say On a star-less night, without a light.;
	say Our caravan passed, with our goods amassed.;
	say Till a party of trolls, on us fell.;
	say Killed and massacred so one can tell.;
	say And now the corpses all smell.;
	say Till their time comes and they ring their bell.;
	say Then they send the soul to hell.;
	}

say { "time";
	say In here we are tortured to death.;
	say And when we are to die with no health.;
	say To a demon, corpses they bring.;
	say The shamans, his name they sing.;
	say Alas all we need is his ring.;
	}

say { "hell";
	link say time;
	}

say { "ring";
	say A ring holding the keys, to these chains that can seize.;
	say Every soul it holds as fees.;
	say Feeding the Iblis, humming like bees.;

say { "Iblis";
	say Far below the secret treasure room of the troll lord.;
	say The trolls use him to torture and reward.;
	say Those with the prince that couldn't afford.;
	say Death while holding their axe and sword.;
	say Seek the keys to unravel these chains.;
	say Kill the demon, become its bane.;
	say Free me and the prince's corpse from this drain.;
	say Perhaps so I may one day become sane.;
	say Maybe using the keys on these chains will bring back my name.;
	toroom $n rears his head and cackles in madness.;

	give parchment %n;
	say Tell him of what happened.;
	say Tell him that a merchant hired the trolls...;
	say to stop the caravan from reaching the mines...;
	say and destroy the trade.;
	toroom $n falls on the floor holding his head in pain;
	say The pain, the screams, the blood, the claws...;
	say the Demon's eyes!  ARRRRGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!;
	toroom $n gets up and looks at you with a mad grin on $s face and insanity beaming through $s eyes.;

You have the power to seek out the <p>earthquake<z> prayer:

The words of your teacher <r>Talar<z> still echo in your mind:
However, before I train you in earthquake, I must ask you to perform a small
task to prove your worth.  In order to prove you are ready for such knowledge,
bring me <y>a yellow boot<z>.

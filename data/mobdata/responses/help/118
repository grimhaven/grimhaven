You have the power to seek out the <p>stone skin<z> spell:

The words of your earth trainer still echo in your mind:
However, I do remember a dwarf that perhaps has such knowledge of using
defensive Earth Magic.  I think the City in the Clouds has the dwarf you seek.
He is a very important abassador there.  Seek him out, he may hold the secrets
you desire.

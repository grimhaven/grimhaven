You have successfully completed your quest for a Ranger's Cloak.
Now you are assisting Jamir in its crafting by gaining certain items...

He has asked that you bargain with the Bullywug Shaman for some special oil.
The Shaman has agreed to make the oil if you kill Venol and his fellow bandits.
You should acquire the staff they stole and return it to the Shaman.

	toroom $n looks up at you with pleading eyes.;
}

say { "hello";
	say Oh thank goodness!  It is such a relief to see someone with two eyes.;
	say I mean, not looking through two eyes, but at someone who has two eyes.;
	say You know what I mean.;
	toroom $n stares at you for a moment.;
	say Anyway, for the honor of Brightmoon, could you <c>help<1> me?;
}

say { "help";
	say Yes, you see, I'm in a bit of a predicament.;
	say During a routine patrol along Cyclops Alley, my squad was attacked.;
	say My fellows bravely fought to the death, as the paladin code requires.;
	say However, I hid in a nearby sticker bush and survived the assault.;
	say I had to surrender afterwards of course, as I was heavily outnumbered.;
	say I realize now that it was truly cowardly of me to do that, and that I've broken the paladin code of honor.;
	say I deserve death; I should have died on the field of battle!;
	say But my honor can be <c>preserved<1>, if you will help.;
}

say { "preserved";
	say Augustine, the Proctor of Brightmoon, must never know of my cowardice.;
	say You must go to him and tell him that you found my corpse, and that I perished bravely in battle.;
	say Just mentioned the <c>missing paladin<1> to him, he will know of who you speak.;
	say This is the only way my honor can be preserved, and my family saved from disgrace.;
	say I... I deserve death.  Before you speak with Augustine, you must finished the cyclopses started.;
	toroom $n straightens up bravely, with resolve in his eyes.;
	say You must <c>slay<1> me.;
}

say { "missing paladin";
	say Yes, just tell that to Augustine, he will know.;
}

say { "slay";
	say No no no!  No wait.  Yes.  I must die, it is the only way.;
	say If I am discovered alive, my name will be worth nothing.;
	say The paladin code is strict, and I will be dishonored, my squad will be dishonored, and my family will be dishonored.;
	say The only way to set my cowardice straight is for you to kill me, and report my bravery in battle to Augustine.;
	say Uhhh... try to make it look like cyclopses did it.;
	nod;
	toroom $n closes his eyes and cringes slightly as he waits.;

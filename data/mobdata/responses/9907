say {"hello";
      toroom $n seems angered.;
      say SHHH I do not wish to draw attention to myself.;
      say Oh but how I wish I could move about my city truly unseen.;
}

say {"unseen";
      frown;
      say Yes unseen, invisible, it's all the same.;   
      say If I was invisible I could move about the city undetected.;
      say But I fear I've used all my invisible ink.;
      say And can not spare the time to locate more.;
}

say {"invisible";
      link say unseen;
}

say {"invisible ink";
      say Invisible ink? Might you have some?;
      say I fear I have no talens I can spare.;
      say But I may have something to trade.;
}

say {"trade";
     say Oh good you are interested in a trade for the Ink?;
     think;
     say Well last week it seems the raiders slaughtered several...;
     say ...greyhounds, I think you call the beasts, on the surface.;
     say We have come across numerous corpses about the city.;
     say And have collected the paws for their magical usefulness.;
     say But to a drow the increased speed is of little use.;
     say So a trade then?  My greyhound paws for your invisible ink?;
}

say {"talens";
      say Talens, even the few I have, are of little use here.;
}

give {"253";
     smile %n;
     say This should work nicely.;
     toroom $n slips away in the shadows quick to return.;
     checkload 260;
     give greyhound-component %n;
     cackle;

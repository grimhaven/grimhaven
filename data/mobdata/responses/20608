say {"hello";
 toroom $n looks up from her tedious work.;
 smile;
 say May I help you?;
 say I must return to my cooking soon.;
}

say {"cooking";
 sigh;
 say Yes I have cooked some othora steaks...; 
 say But it seems my mate will be late coming home again.;
 say I hate seeing him have to eat cold or reheated meat.;
 say He tries to look like he enjoys it...but I know he doesn't;
 say I was hoping to trade them to someone in the village...;
 say For some raw othora steaks I could cook when he comes home.;

 toroom $n quickly moves to put the steak away and get the cooked one.;
 thank %n;

 toroom $n seems to have a permanent smile upon her face.;

say {"hello";
 toroom $n moves about you sniffing you up and down.;
 say Well met, you not smell of the veldt, a wetlander?;
}

say {"wetlander";
 smile;
 say A wetlander, then you have not heard of Kunta!;
 say Kunta, hunter of cheetahs!;
 say Kunta, fastest creature in the veldt!;
 toroom $n continues his proud boasting for some time.;
}

say {"cheetah";
 say I track and hunt the cheetahs.;
 say So I may kill them and eat their hearts!;
 say Letting their spirit lend speed to my feet.;
 say I have many trophies to prove this to you.;
}

say {"trophies";
 say Yes, while I eat the heart of the cheetah.;
 say The rest I keep for trophies.;
 say The pelt to sleep upon.;
 say The skull to wear during my dance.;
 say And its tail to wear as a belt about my waist.;
}

say {"paw";
 say I keep the paws, but have little use for them.;
 say Would you like to trade maybe?;
 say Since you seem interested in them.;
}

say {"trade";
 smile;
 say I little need your money.;
 say But sometimes traders have these combs, they name them...;
 say filled with some sweet sticky substance they call honey.;
 say Its taste pleases me and seems to make me eager to run!;
 say I will trade you one paw for such a honey comb.;
}

give {"10942";
 toroom $n seems on the brink of drooling!;
 toroom $n quickly wraps the honey comb and packs it away.;
 say Such a wonderful treat mother nature gives us.;
 say Here is your cheetah's paw as we spoke about.;
 load 261;
 give cheetah-component %n;
 say A fast one she was too, but not as fast as Kunta!;
 grin;

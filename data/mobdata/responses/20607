say {"hello";
 toroom $n lays something aside hastily.;
 toroom $n snaps to attention attempting to look serious.;
 say Move along, be about your business.;
 toroom You seem to detect a strange odor of fish about the young warrior.;
}

say {"fish";
 blush;
 toroom $n seems downcast as if caught.;
 say Yes I was about to eat on duty.; 
 say I'm not supposed to but I am very hungry.;
 say Unfortunately all I have is this dried fish.;
 say While it lasts longer and is good for the trail...;
 say What I'd really prefer is a nice fresh raw fillet instead.;
 say I'd gladly trade you...;
 say If you get a chance to fish for some in the Springs.;
}

give {"20636";
 toroom $n seems on the verge of drooling.;
 toroom $n looks both ways and then quickly devours the raw fish!;
 toroom $n licks his lips seeming to enjoy the after taste.;
 thank %n;
 load 20637;
 give fish-dried-fillet %n;
 toroom $n suddenly takes a stern stance.;
 say Now move along, be about your business.;

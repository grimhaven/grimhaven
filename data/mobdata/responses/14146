      toroom $n seems to hold back a tear.;
      say Yes, I have failed in my duties.;
      say Not only did the Gnomish Center of Knowledge fall...;
      say But I have lost the Blade I was intrusted with.;
      say Furthermore, Lixlor now taunts me with it's broken remains.;

      say The Blade of Gnulis the Brave.;
      say It was intrusted to each overseer of the Center.;
      say But in our battle I lost it to Lixlor's minions.;
      say Now he enjoys periodically tormenting me with this fact.;
      say I do so wish someone would retrieve the broken blade from him.;
      sigh;

      smile;
      say You would retrieve the Blade of Gnulis from Lixlor?;
      say He only keeps it with him occassionally.;
      say The other times he keeps it safely hidden away.;
      say Even broken it remains a formidable weapon.;
      say But if you were to return it to me...;
      say I have the skill to once again make it whole.;

   toroom $n examines the Blade closely.;
   sigh;
   say I fear this is but a forged copy of the mighty Blade.;
   say The true Blade has already been stripped from Lixlor.;
   say He now seeks to torment me with illusions and trickery.;
   say I fear you have been caught up in his poor jokes.;
   say Take this with my blessing and thanks for your efforts.;
   toroom $n seems to form something from thin air within her grasp.;

   say You are a mightly adventurer for sure...;
   say If you have defeated Lixlor for this Blade.;
   toroom $n holds the Blade of Gnulis aloft.;
   toroom $n speaks a low prayer which causes the Blade to glow.;
   toroom The light about the Blade intensifies seeming to consume it.;
   toroom As the light begins to fade you see the Blade is once more whole!;
   toroom $n seems exhausted from the effort.;
   say My thanks for your help.;
   say No more can Lixlor torment me with this failure.;

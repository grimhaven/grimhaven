say {"hello";
        toroom $n looks up from his thoughts.;
        say Can I help you?;
        say I didn't know their were guests in the house.;
        say I was just doing a bit of research.;
    }

say {"research";
        say Oh just a little bit of research for a friend.;
        say I just came from the library at the Mage Tower.;
        say The one in the Obsidian Citadel.;
        say Much larger then this but unfortunately didn't have what I need.;
        say By the way did you say what you needed?;
        say If nothing I'll get back to my research.;
    }

say {"library";
        say Oh yes quite a nice library there.;
        say Not quite as cozy as this on.;
        say Quite a trip to get there though I'm afraid.;
        say Luckily I learned a quick portal spell which brought me here.;
        say Nice little portal, what did you need again?;
    }

        say Luckily I learned a quick portal spell which brought me here.;
        say Nice little portal, what did you need again?;
    }

say {"portal";
        say Yes its a nice spell, but quite taxing.;
        say On both the mind and moneypouch if ya get my drift.;
        say I might be able to whip one up for you to the Obsidian Citadel.;
        say For appropriate compensation of course, the arts are never cheap.;
        say Lets say about 10000 talens each.;
        say Since each portal seems to only be good for one person.;
        say One small drawback to the spell it seems.;
        say I'll have to work on that I guess.;
    }

say {"spell";
        say Yes well its a grand spell, makes a nice portal.;
        say Afraid its not something I could teach any of you though.;
        say Well been nice talking to you.;
        toroom $n turns back to his studies.;
    }

give {"-8000";
        say Well that seems to be enough I guess.;
        say Just one moment please.;
        toroom $n digs deep into his pouches.;
        toroom $n tosses some odd powder high into the air speaking arcane words.;
        toroom As the powder begins to glow $n shapes it into an oval shape.;
        load 9972;
        drop portal;
        toroom $n seems rather exhausted.;
        say Well there you go, anyone else?;
     }

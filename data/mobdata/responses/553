say {"hello";
      toroom $n looks up from his duties.;
      bow %n;
      say Hello.;
      say Can I help you with something?;
      say If you need a room or to board an animal....;
      say ...you'll need to see the innkeeper at the Inn.;
      say If your looking for a spare mount, Roth might be able to help you.;
      say But all I do is work with the tack and caring for the animals...;
      say If you need a saddle or something, I might be able to help you there.;       
}

say {"paniers";
      say These paniers are large wicker chests you can saddle on your mount.;
      say Unfortunately, they're too large to accomodate a rider on the animal,;
      say So getting it to follow you around could be a bit of a challenge.;
      say Anyway, a pair of paniers will cost you 3576 talens.;
}

say {"saddle";
      say Need some tack you say?;
      think;
      say Yes, I think we have a few worn saddles lying around.;
      say I suppose Roth wouldn't mind if I sold one.;
      say But he'll skin me if I don't get at least #OBJCOST(18, 25)# talens.;
      say Also, I've got a few saddlebag sets, and some wicker paniers.;
}

say {"bags";
      say Yeah, I've repaired a few of the saddlebag sets that got left here.;
      say ...but these are a pain to make, so its gonna cost ya at least.;
      say 5628 talens for one of these - but well worth the gold.;
}

}

say {"animal";
      say Yes we have some fine animals here.;
      say A few not so fine ones as well though.;
      say But no matter, they pay me well to take care of them either way.;
}

give {"-#OBJCOST(18, 25)#";
      toroom $n quickly counts the money.;
      say Bargain struck.  Lets see what we can find.;
      toroom $n moves about looking over various tack.;
      say Ahh this one should do.;
      load 18;
      give saddle %n;
      say That should serve your needs.;
      toroom $n returns to his duties.;

give {"-5628";
      toroom $n quickly counts the money.;
      say Looks about right, gimmie a second...;
      toroom $n digs around in the tack.; 
      say Here's a nice set.;
      load 552;

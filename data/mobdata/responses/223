# Monk Sash Quest, Green

      smile;
      say You may not know this, but on my spare time I am something of a scientist.  Being a hermit, I have a lot of spare time, as you can imagine.  I would like to show you one of my recent theories.;
      toroom $n lights a lantern in a shadowy corner of the room where some charts are hanging that you had previously failed to notice.;
      toroom On the charts are many carefully drawn formulas which you fail to understand, as well as some pictures.  They seem to show a number of different animals falling off cliffs.;
      toroom Each sequence contains three or four frames, starting at the top of the cliff just as the animal begins falling and finishing on the ground showing the position of the animal upon landing.;
      toroom You notice that the giraffe, the rhino and the wolf all land on their sides or their heads, but the cat, the lion and the elephant are indicated as landing soundly on their feet.;
      say As you can see, I have been examining the manner in which different animals fall and land.  Once my studies are complete, I hope to teach monks the art of falling great distances and landing safely.;
      say Now, according to my calculations, elephants can always land on their feet, despite their great size.  Obviously, this is of great interest to me.  This is where you come in, %n.  I need someone to find an elephant with which to test my theory.;
      tell %n Say 'I will test your theory, guildmaster' if you will help.;

      tell %n Ok, all you need to do is find an elephant.  You should be able to get one from the Veldt somewhere.;
      tell %n Take the elephant to Cimea, AKA The Cloud City.  Once there you should be able to find a way to jump off.;
      tell %n Be certain to observe the elephant all the way down, it is essential that you relate to me every twist and turn the elephant makes as well as its landing!;
      tell %n The fall may be, um, somewhat hazardous, but I'm sure it's nothing a strapping youngster like yourself can't handle.;

say { "green sash";
       checktoggle 154;
       tovict You describe in precise detail the motions of the elephant as it fell, as well as its landing.;
       say Well done!  I'm not exactly sure what effect this has on my research just yet, but it is extremely helpful nonetheless.;

       tovict Once you understand the theory, you stop him before he hurts himself.;

       checktoggle 161;
       say Yes, the implications of the catfall research are staggering.;
       say I think that I may be able to study and master the great leaps that felines make!;
       tovict Your mentor takes a flying leap from the bed, nearly colliding with a table.;
       say If I can study the motion of a flying feline, I believe I can replicated their leaping abilities.;
       say I implore you to obtain a pet cat in Grimhaven, imbue it with the flight spell, and bring it to me.;
       say Let me know when you are ready for me to research <c>catleaping<1>.;

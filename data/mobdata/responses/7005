	toroom $n looks away uninterested, studying an imagine before $m.;
	toroom Looking at the image you see it's a large signet ring.;

say {"signet";
	say You're a bright one aren't you, of course it's a signet ring.;
	say More importantly it's the King's Royal Signet Ring.;
	say With it I can rule this Citadel without Mercees pestering.;
	say I have a plan to get it from the King.;
	say But I need someone's help to deliver a message for me.;
	}

say {"plan";
	say Yes I have an plan to trick the King into giving it to me.;
	say Would you perhaps want to deliver a message for me?;

	toroom $n suddenly grabs a quill and parchment from thin air.;
	toroom $n quickly scribbles a note upon the parchment.;
	toroom $n drops the quill into thin air where it vanishes.;
	say Take this message to the King.;
	give note %n;
	say If he'll not give the Signet to you, find another way.;
	say But I expect you to have his Signet next I see you.;
	say I'd not return unless you have it, I'll be most upset.;

say {"reward";
	think;
	say I'll give you a scroll I've had lying around for ages.;
	say It's of little use to me here in the Tower.;
	say Now go and get me the King's Signet in exchange.;
	tovict $n turns away from you.;
	tonotvict $n turns away from %n;

	load 7091;
 	toroom $n slips the Signet upon his finger.;
	toroom $n gasps in surprise and pain as the ring suddenly begins to glow.;
	toroom You are blinding for a second by a bright flash of light.;
	toroom $n screams, "No!...I swore I had the answer this time!";
	growl;
	tovict $n turns in your direction.;
	tonotvict $n turns in %n's direction.;
	say This is your fault %n, you must have distracted me!;
 	say Take your reward and be gone, I'll not have you say I cheated you.;
	toroom $n reaches into the air and pulls out a dusty scroll.;
	give scroll %n;
	}

  say Yep, big old pirate ship went down the other night, to the east of here.;
  say It was an awful storm, lightning and such, worse than I usually see around these parts.;
  say If you head to the east a little ways and push aside the kelp, I'm sure you'll see it.;
  say Be careful now, you never know what you might find down there.;
  say In fact, I recommend staying away entirely!;

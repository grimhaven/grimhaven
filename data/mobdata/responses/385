      checktoggle 135;
      tovict You explain that you need to bring some tobacco ash to your guildmaster.;
      think;

      tell %n I can see no recourse but to scour the oceans seeking this shark.;
      tell %n Be sure to bring a good strong boat or raft and plenty of food.;
      tell %n A good supply of fresh water would certainly be in order, since you can't drink ocean water.;
      tell %n Oh, and if you start getting sucked into a whirlpool, swim like hell.;
      grin;
      say Good luck, you'll need it.;

# Monk Sash Quest #5, Green Sash
# Advice from Huang'lo
# Peel

say { "green sash";
      checktoggle 152; 
      tovict You explain your quest to $n, seeking advice.;
      tonotvict %n has a short conversation with $n.;
      cackle;
      say That old fool!  Doesn't he know that since elephants are heavier, they fall faster and therefore don't have time to get their feet under them when they land?;
      tell %n Nevertheless, I suppose you must do as he asks.  You may find an elephant in the Veldt of course.  To get to the Veldt, go south of Grimhaven, then follow the road east.;
      tell %n When you reach the four-way intersection just before Logrus, turn south to the next split in the road.;
      tell %n At that point, follow the east/southeast split and you will eventually arrive at the Veldt.;
      tell %n As for the Cloud City, well, you are on your own there.  It has been many years since I have visited that place and I do not recall the way.;
      say As always, good luck my friend.;

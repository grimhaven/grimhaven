say { "beer";
     say Our Lager,;
     say Which art in Barrels,;
     say Hallowed be thy drink.;
     say Thy will be drunk,;
     say At Home as it is in the Pub.;
     say Give us this day our foamy head,;
     say And forgive us our spillages,;
     say As we forgive those who spill against us.;
     say And lead us not to incarceration,;
     say But deliver us from hangovers.;
     say For thine is the Beer,;
     say The Bitter and The Lager.;
     say For ever and ever.;
     say BARMEN!;
        }

say {"hello";
 toroom $n swims boldly about you.;
 say Hello land dweller.;
}

say {"siren";
 say The siren's should be avoided land dweller.;
 say Their song is tempting to any.;
 say Many of my kind brave their singing each moon.;
 say In an attempt to grow immune to their enchanted ways.;
 say Many do not return with the proof of their deed...;
 say Others return not at all...;
 sigh;
}

say {"proof";
 say Each brave elf must return with a bit of the siren's hair.;
 say To prove they have indeed seen and touched the creatures.;
 toroom $n puffs his chest out proudly, boasting...;
 say I have made it each moon since my 150th birthday.;
 say I have a bit indeed of their hair now.;
 say It is said to have magical properties.;
 say Might you be interested in some?;
}

say {"interested";
 think;
 say Your money means little to me.;
 say I only keep what little I require.;
 say But my brethren of the land speak of a great delicacy.;
 say They call them acorns, I have only had a few...;
 say And find them quite appealing, though exotic.;
 say I will give you a bit of hair for each you bring me.;
}

say {"yes";
 link say interested;
}

give {"10108";
 smile;
 toroom $n quickly cracks the acorn's shell eating the meat within.;
 say MMMM, quite good.;
 say My thanks for this delicacy.;
 say As promised...;
 load 251;
 give siren-component %n;
 toroom $n swims off a bit still seeming to savor the taste.;

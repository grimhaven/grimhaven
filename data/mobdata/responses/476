say {"hello";
 grunt;
 say What do you want?;
}

say {"barkskin";
 toroom $n grumbles about young fools.;
 say So your interested in acquiring some barkskin eh?;
 say Well there are two places I've found it.;
 grin;
 say Perhaps if you were to buy me a shot of whiskey I might recall.;
}

give {"412";
 smile;
 toroom $n tosses back the shot with a sigh of pleasure.;
 say Now you were asking about barkskin.;
 say For one the brownies within the Valley near Shire often have it.;
 say The spellcrafters only though, but they'll not likely trade it.;
 say Now the gnome trappers sometimes find it and will trade.;
 say You might wish to talk to them if a fight is not what you seek.;
 say Now leave me be.;
 toroom $n looks away expecting you to leave.;

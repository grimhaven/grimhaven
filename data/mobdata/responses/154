	smile %n; 
	say Hello %n, are you interested in one of our tasty meals?;
	}

say { "tasty";
        beam %n;
        say Yes, very tasty indeed!;
	whisper %n But our best food is on the <r>secret<1> menu.;
        whisper %n Those are very expensive though and you probably aren't interested...;
	}

say { "secret";
	toroom $n looks around suspiciously.;
	whisper %n Ah, so you are interested in the <r>secret<1> menu.;
        tell %n We've got many very fine and expensive delicacies for you to choose from.;
	tell %n But they aren't exactly, ah, legal.  So just keep this between you and me ok?;
        wink %n;
        tell %n Ok, we've some very nice pickled elf ear appetizers for #OBJCOST(439, 25)# talens a pair.;
	tell %n Human drunkard kidney pie for #OBJCOST(440, 20)# talens.;

	}

give { "-#OBJCOST(439, 25)#";
	load 439;
	say Here's a nice pair, crunchy and salty, MMMM.;
	give pickled-elf-ears %n;
	}
give { "-#OBJCOST(440, 20)#";
	load 440;
	say Ahh yes, tender and juicy, naturally marinated in alcohol.  Very yummy indeed.;
	give drunkard-kidney-pie %n;
	}
give { "-#OBJCOST(441, 20)#";
	load 441;
	say This jerky is extremely tough, but quite good and it does last a long time.;
	give ogre-skin-jerky %n;
	}
give { "-#OBJCOST(442, 25)#";
	load 442;
	say Just the right size for nibbling, these ribs are nice and meaty like all dwarves, but lack the tough sinew and muscle that develops in later life.;
	give dwarf-child-ribs %n;
	}
give { "-#OBJCOST(443, 20)#";
	load 443;
	say Oh my, our very best dish.  This stew is made from minced brain of a human child, no more than 6 years old.;
 	say It is prepared and served directly from the skull for extra flavor.;
	say The ears are still attached, you can eat them for appetizers.;
        grin;
	give human-child-brain-stew %n;
	}


say {   "Peel";
	cringe;
	say Peel is the devil!  I was forced to sell Him my soul to get me out of... a bad situation.;
	say Ever since then my hunger for humanoid flesh has been extreme.;
	say I must sell specialized items on the <r>secret<1> menu, in order to afford my appetite.;
	say I shudder to think of the <k>evils<1> I have committed in procuring these items.;
	moan;
}

say {	"evil";
	say NO!  I will not speak of it.;
	say That bastard Peel will pay someday.  Many citizens of this world owe their souls to Him and are forced into similar fates.;
	say I know that He only does it for His personal amusement.;
	say He spreads <k>evil<1> and <k>strife<1> and someday it must end!;
	fume;
	toroom Suddenly, his anger fades like smoke in a gust of wind.;
	say But I am not strong enough to do it.  I don't know if anyone is or ever will be.;
	sigh;

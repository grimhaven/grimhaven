 say The fire demon which aids me demands many sacrifices.;

 say And I am to prepare her...;
 say Draining every last drop of blood from her body.;
 say Or the demon will turn on me!;

 say I can trade it easily on most markets.;
 say Perhaps you would be interested in such a trade?;

 say My duties require me to stay here.;
 say But I desire some pickled elf ears, quite a delicacy.;

 say Many cannibal tribes give their children these as treats.;
 say I'll give you some blood of a scorned woman.;
 say For each pair of these you bring me.;

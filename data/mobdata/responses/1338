  say Let me tell you first what a pleasure it is to meet such a righteous adventurer.  Elyon is proud of such a noble soul.;
  say What you will find within these walls is more than protection and commerce:  here, you will enjoy tranquility and peace of mind, as well.;
  say It has been many, many years since any hostility befell the quiet walls of this great seaside haven.;
  say Galek, the wise founder of this remarkable port, saw fit to leave us with a creed that has ensured prosperity throughout the centuries.;
  say It is this creed that gives us our strength and respect for one another.;
  say As you learn of the Brotherhood, you should ponder who it is you are and whence you came.;
  say It is within that knowledge that you will find the strength of the Brotherhood.;
  say When you have accepted these teachings, as well as your heritage, please embrace that truth by professing your joining with us.;
  say First thou must go forth and learn of your personal worth.  Seek out the humble field workers of Brightmoon, learn of their wisdom and follow their guidance.;
  say May Jevon the merciful guide and be with you brother.;

say {"contraption";
        toroom $n looks up from his work eager to chat.;
	say Well at this particular moment I'm working on a device...;
	say to accurately measure the density of a cloud stone.;
}

say {"cloud stone";
	say Yes, I occasionally find them when I'm out exploring.;
	say Using my whirleypack of course.;
	say It's the darnest thing, I'll just be flying along,;
	say minding my own business, and these things will suddenly...;
	say come falling out of the sky to pelt my little head.;
        say Hurts a good deal I might add.;
        say I managed to collect a few the last time it happened.;
        say Hoping to experiment on a few of them.;
        say But my credit at the store seems to be running a little short.;
        say To finish this contraption.;
}

say {"credit";
        blush;
        stare;
	say Well it seems my whirleypack went a little over budget.;
	say Say!  You wouldn't be interested in buying some of these?;
        say As much as I hate to part with them...I really could use the talens.;
	say Just let me know if your interested.;
}

say {"interested";
        toroom $n seems to suddenly get rather serious and business-like.;
	say Well now, these aren't easy to come by.;
	say And are rather interesting to study.;
	say But as I said I've some overdue debts.;
        toroom $n seems to add up a few things on his fingers, and toes.;
	say I think #OBJCOST( 204, 21)# talens is a fair price, and not a talen less.;
}

give {"-#OBJCOST( 204, 20)#";
        frown;
        say Well I guess times can be tight on all of us.;
        load 204;
        give component-stone-cloud %n;
        say You're getting a good deal there you know!;
}

give {"-#OBJCOST( 204, 21)#";
        smile;
	say Oh yes, this will help me out nicely.;
	load 204;
	give component-stone-cloud %n;
        say As per our agreement.;
}

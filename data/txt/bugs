Well, as is normal, let's chaulk another thing up that
you CANNOT DO 
while disguised.  Besides interacting with mobs in
most any way, buying 
things, participating in quests, renting, using the
hospitals, etc etc.  
Add to the list that you cannot extinguish yourself
(ie: extinguish me) 
when disguised, and as a result you lose precious eq. 
Is this really a 
bug?  Probably not since the person who originally
coded disguise 
didn't think of these things in the first place. 
Forgive my sarcasm.  I do 
realize that it isn't helping my cause but, really,

Subject: [Bug] Trophy List - Chaos Garrison Dungeon (Shota)
The trophy list seems to only load 8 mobs in this zone, but but trophy indicates that there should be 9.  Hence 8/9 mobs on the trophy list is the best you can do.  It is possible that there is a hidden room/ hidden mob here, however, I have dont my best to scour this zone for the final mob, and been unable to find it.  It may load elsewhere in the game, and I have yet to come across it whereever it might be located.  But it is a rather small, starter type zone that I would not assume to be overly intricate enough to place a mob outside its own zone borders.  If there is some problem, and the last mob is not loading in the game, either have the mob load, remove it (somehow) from the trophy list for the Chaos Garrison Dungeon (perhaps moving it to a newly created "unused mob" section would be easier?)   There are other issues with trophy, certain disabled zones still count for trophy purposes (most notably the numerous chaos plains, etc zones by mithros).  Yet those mobs were once in the game, and there are people who have killed those mobs in this version, so I dont think they should be removed.  However, it would be nice to potentially get to 100% killed in any enabled zones - some of which include trainers, and are artifically inflated with mobs.  I think one zone may also include "testmobs" of all levels, but those mobs get used from time to time at least.  Once of my characters has killed one in helping with some experiment.  Perhaps those should be reclassified or something...  Obviously, this is not a pressing issue, but its something that bothers me - any potential trophy list errors, etc.  When stuck one mob short, and investing way too much time looking for a mob, merely because it doesnt load, and thus cannot be found.  Shopkeepers/noheal mobs are a separate issue - sinec they are in the game, but I at least, havent found a way to get them out to fight them.

Subject: Selling Potions in Shops
Not a big thing, just kind of annoying that i can't change it - i have access to Crossroads of the Arkane (from MS, 6s, 2e) - i can change the price of all scrolls and other potions, but i brewed 10 rusty potions, and i can't change the price on them - they're stuck at 37k.  If this problem cannot be fixed so that i can change the price, please set the price of rusty potions to 22,000 talens or there abouts.  Cheers, Fedaykin

Another problem is giving a mob that loaded leprosy then log off.  After a few hours, the mob's limbs will have fallen off so it cannot fight back.  While the current cleric fixes balanced the class a lot, the disease prayer has not been addressed.  There should be a check against the level of the mob to see whether the disease prayer succeeeds or not, as the other prayers within affliction currently works.

killing mobs and transfering eq
Currently, if someone uses a high level pc to kill a mob that loaded good eq then leave the eq in the corpse for the person's lowbie to loot, the eq disappears because of multiplay.  Clerics have a way around this.  By giving the mob infect then hurting the mob up to near death, clerics can have the mob die from bleeding or infection.  Then the cleric's lowbie pc can come and loot it without this scenario falling under the multiplay code that makes eq disintegrate.

Changes to Hurl- Good job, but one problem:
So I'm fully cool with the addition of command lockout to hurl, but- if you try to hurl a mob that is on the ground, it displays the message 'you can't hurl X when they are on the floor!', which again, is fine except that it still gives you the 2.8 second lockout. Shouldn't do that in this case, since no actual attempt to hurl has been made.  Cheers

Looks like its possible an immort artfically inflated the leather commodity in GH, or a player sold alot of leather. In any event leather shortages continue in BM and LG.   Note:  1) BM is now experiences shortages in all types of leather 2) Leather commodities in BM and GH (what i've tested) dont show as listed. If you sell one commodity of that type, say toughen leather, the option to purachase that commodity become available.  Being the commodity trader that I am I started to move GH surpplus of toughen leather, dwarven leather, leather, to BM which did not have any, but stopped after thinking about the last time this similar type problem occured.

Unique items loading every other reboot?
Twice it has happened that I possess a certain "large metal key" and when the MUD crashes, the key doesn't load in its proper place, but next reboot it does.  This is of course no proof of the bug, for someone might have sped and relieved me of possession of the said key which I cherish greatly.

Obsidian Citadel Quest response
You say, "scepter" The treasure guard says, "The King's Royal Scepter?  Yes it should be here." The treasure guard says, "But I can't help you unless you have a key." The treasure guard says, "Give me the key and I'll open the chest it should be in."  You give a key made of black wax to the treasure guard. The treasure guard says, "One moment.  It should be here somewhere." The treasure guard turns away looking for the appropriate chest.  No response after this, the thief i was with said the treasure guard had a melted pile of black wax in his inventory, but failed to deliever the goods. Maybe response is broken, or maybe I'm missing something?

This is obviously a bug! XD  -- Also, same problem with disarm. In addition, a competent warrior/monk/thief etc should be able to disarm with a weapon in their main hand. I imagine it would be some sort of fancy dagger/sword technique.

H:264 P:73.6 V:135 T:183918  <elite=good> <0.3> >  You cleave an elite King's Guard's body severely with your mace. Baal shreds an elite King's Guard's body hard.

Your emerald glows with power! Your fighting distracts you from your prayer. Hmm, your attempt to blind an elite King's Guard failed. Ack, you seem to have blinded yourself. Ack, you can't see a damn thing!  Who turned out the lights?  H:257 P:61.1 V:135 T:183918  <elite=injured> <1.4> >  Baal shreds an elite King's Guard's body hard. Baal shreds an elite King's Guard's right leg severely. Baal shreds an elite King's Guard's back hard. Baal shreds an elite King's Guard's neck hard.   Notice how I can still see? Thats cause I had true sight. Or more accurately, clarity. I shouldn't be blindable, but in this particular failed prayer case, I got blinded anyway.  Disregard if there has been some change to blind/ts code.

Subject: Oh the humanity!
You evaluate your limbs and their health. Your right arm is slightly wounded. Your left arm is in near perfect condition. Your right wrist is slightly wounded. Your right hand is slightly wounded. Your left hand is slightly wounded. Your waist is slightly wounded. Your left leg is in extremely bad shape. Your left leg is useless! Your left leg is bruised! Your right foot is in extremely bad shape. Your right foot is useless! Your right foot is bruised! Your left foot is mildly wounded.  Both legs are useless, but I still have flight. I should be able to fly without having to stand first. Or be able to pray while on my knees.... imagine that! Crazy, I know. People should expect this kind of insanity from me though. :D

burn bug kind of duplicates shit
 This is just one burning corpse:  What used to be the corpse of a large grey wolf lies here, scrapped. [2] The corpse of a large grey wolf lying on the ground looks bashed and bludgeoned. (charred)  The bug looks like this when it occurs:  H:162 T:11854 N:457,280 >  The corpse of a large grey wolf crackles merrily as it burns down. The corpse of a large grey wolf is destroyed. The fire spreads to the corpse of a large grey wolf and it begins to burn!   I noticed it burning some moneypouches the other day too. There were like 50 moneypouches and 300 scraps and still all the moneypouches. I think they were empty though I do not think it duplicated the contents. Not sure. Have a nice day.

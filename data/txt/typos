clarification
this thing only happens when you "get all": You start picking up things from the room. You get a cyan potion. the helm of the Tequila Sunrise is attached and is not getable. a large brass lamp is attached and is not getable. a sun-bleached hammock is attached and is not getable. a sun-bleached hammock is attached and is not getable. There is nothing more to get here!  If you just try to get the item it's normal: a large brass lamp : You can't take that.  or if you try to get all when there's nothing you can geet, it's normal too. k, there we go.

Quest Toggles
-----------------

Quest toggles are hard coded state variables that allow a response quest to
be set up and run automatically.  They are best illustrated through example.

At level 10, a person becomes eligible for a given quest.  The guildmaster
would be set up to set quest-toggle 10 on this person and to go see a certain
mob.

The mob indicated could then be set up with a roomenter response.  The first
action would be checktoggle 10.  Subsequent actions would be says, tells, etc.
Thus, if a person comes in and has the quest-toggle 10 set, the mob will
talk to them.  Otherwise, it probably will do nothing.

Eventually, the mob would describe some chore the person is to perform.  If
the person accepts the task, the mob could untoggle 10 and toggle 11.
A new response could be set up for if person comes back in with 11 set.
  checktoggle 11;
  say %n, why are you back here?  Go and finish your task.;

Thus by checking toggles, setting new toggles and unsetting old toggle, the
person can proceed through the quest and have things occur at the proper time.

Quest toggles are saved in the person's playerfile.  They will last through
reboot and rent.  Multiple people can be on the same quest simultaneously.

Toggle quests may need code in order to have the initial toggle assigned at
a certain time (gained a level, reached a learningness).  Other code may be
required if exotic events (like combat with a given mob) need to check, set
and unset toggles.

The toggle numbers have to be assigned by the coder (so they are linked
properly to the proper bit on the player's file).

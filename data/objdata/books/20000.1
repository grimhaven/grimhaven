Chapter 1: Introduction.

Welcome.  You are about to read all about the <h> tournament.  We 
hope that you have as much fun playing it as we have had in putting it 
together.  

The tournament will be held over a weekend.  There will be events
scheduled throughout Saturday and Sunday so everyone should be able to
find a good event or events to participate in.  See tournament board for 
precise dates of all events. 

This book will generally describe what events are planned and how to sign
up.  Events will be held throughout the mud and will be for all level of
player.  Newbies to the mud will be on an equal footing with experienced
players in a large number events.  Any event in which this would not be
true, will be clearly identified.  In addition, all such events will be
designed so that participants compete only against similar level players. 
All events are designed for the participation of both <h> newbies and
experienced players.  Besides the special events designed for the
tournament, there will be mud areas, trivia, and hopefully sleep tag open
for those who are not participating in a specific event. 

Many of the events will be held in a tournament arena setting so they will
not lead to experience loss or gain.  Others (especially the mud wide
events) will involve normal play including experience gain and loss but
are not designed to cause deaths.  There will be no reimbursements for
deaths in these events. 

Prizes will be given out to winners.  These prizes will be nice and reward
you for your efforts.  However, except for certain main events, do not
expect these prizes to be extra special items.  Hopefully, the tournament
events will be fun in themselves and give bragging rights to the winners. 
The prizes are intended to just add a little reward to the winners.  

In honor of the day, the gods will provide food and drink for all so you
can hang out and observe to your hearts content. 

For more information, read the rest of this book, read the event books,
read the tournament board or ask a God identified in his or her title as a
"Tournament Organizer".  That god will probably direct you to the
tournament board and these information books so you may be placed in an
infinite loop unless you read further.  The board will also contain
additional events and information not contained in this or the other
tournament books.  Do not bother other gods about the Tournament unless
they so identify themselves in their title.

What is a Client?
-----------------

Clients are external programs that assist the player by handling tedious
chores for them.  They typically offer aliases (the ability to substitute
a pattern of keystrokes for a much longer series: eg: FOOD = get food bag,
eat food, burp), actions (the ability to automatically perform some
action when certain text is sent to the character: eg: "You are hungry" =
eat bread) and other features (substitutions, highlights, gagging and
ease of playing multiple characters from one terminal).

The implementors do recommend their use although they do require some
skill to use well and may just confuse the beginner.  UNIX users should
probably use TinTin++ available via anonymous FTP from:
   ftp.math.okstate.edu:/pub/muds/clients/UnixClients/
other systems (VMS, DOS, ...) available from:
   ftp.math.okstate.edu:/pub/mud/clients/

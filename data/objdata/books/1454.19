The 'A' command
Area randomizer.

Declares the boundary of a random area.  For example, if you want something
to load in a random spot within a block of rooms, you can use the 'A'
command.

Syntax: A 0 <start> <end>

<Start> must be less than, and different from, <end>.

The A command only DECLARES the random room.  To actually use the room
declared, set -99 for the room in the pertinent command.

example:
A 0 100 245
M 0 103 1 -99

The mob #103 will be loaded somewhere in the range 100-245.

Please note that once something is loaded using the random area declared, the
area is "forgotten".  You will need to redeclare the range in order to reuse
it (in which case a brand new room is chosen).

Any room within the range is selected.  There is no way to skip certain rooms.
Rooms that are blank will NOT be chosen.

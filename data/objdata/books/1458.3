Getting Help and Other Info
---------------------------

SneezyMUD has a number of resources to assist you when you need help with
the game.  Here's a list:

1)  Our helpfiles.  Type "HELP" to see a basic menu, or type "HELP <thing>"
    to see help on that thing.
    
2)  Our website.  Go to http://www.sneezymud.com/Help.html for several
    resources such as our visual helpfiles.
    
3)  The SneezyMUD Wiki. Go to http://wiki.sneezymud.com to peruse the
    imported help files as well as information on races, classes, items,
    strategy and more. All spoilers will be marked with the spoiler tag
    at the top of the page to allow you to avoid them if you want.
    
4)  Our forums.  Visit http://forums.sneezymud.com/ to catch up on our
    chatter.  It's a great resource for asking advice from other players
    and seeing who is selling and buying at the marketplace.

5)  Our players.  Use the "who" command to see who is flagged a (Newbie-
    Helper) and send them a "tell".  Even those who forget to toggle the
    newbie helper flag are often very happy to help.

6)  Our volunteers.  Should you require assistance with your account, feel
    you've found a bug or are stuck with something, the gods may be able
    to provide some help.  Gods are restricted from providing certain
    information about the world to players and are also restricted from
    interfering in the mortal realm, but they are happy to help you with
    whatever they can.  You can type "who -g" to see what gods are online.
    
    Sometimes, gods may be online but away from the window or keyboard for
    some reason.  If you don't get a response right away, please feel free
    to visit http://www.sneezymud.com/Contact_Us.html and leave us a 
    message.  Any god that checks in will see your message and will get
    back to you via your preferred method as soon as possible.

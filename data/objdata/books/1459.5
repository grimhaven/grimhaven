LEARNING BY DOING and DISCIPLINES

Learning comes from two places.  You obtain a skill set using practices
and you get actual learning by actually using the skills themselves.  This
includes combat and other automatic skills like dodge.  How learned a
person is will be a combination of the two systems and what combination
depends on the individual skill.  Please understand that we do not
consider learning rates structural.  If a learning rate seems to slow or
fast that is a balance issue and is now easy to fix.  We want to hear
about all balance issues without reservation.  Structural issues we want
to hear about but we also know that you can not please everyone.  Our
structures will only be modified if they are clearly not correct.  We are
aware of the tradeoffs that we have made for 5.0 (see section on balance
verse diversity) and believe we have gained more than we have lost in this
area.

Disciplines were re-organized into basic disciplines and advanced
disciplines.  All pre reqs were moved into your basic disciplines which
consist of 2-3 disciplines for each class.  One holds the basic skill of
the class.  The other holds basic combat or casting skills or learning
numbers.  You know learn adventuring and get your wizardry/faith level
directly from your guildmaster although you can also use (waste) practices
on them if you just have to get a skill early.  Tactics and evaluate are
part of the adventuring discipline now and combat is reserved for combat
skills.  Specialization comes after you have finished your basic
disciplines and you will get different practices/level and learn the
disciplines at different rates.  Again see separate section and help files
for full explanations.

Use the "goto" command to find your class trainer by typing:
"<c>goto trainer<z>"

Follow the directions until you are standing in the same room 
with your thief trainer.

Note: As a thief, your trainer is wisely in hiding and it is
up to you to properly find him.  The goto command will lead
you one room away, and you must find the hidden entrance.

The room your trainer is in is dimly lit, so it is suggested
that you bring and light a torch to see properly.

Once you're there, use some of your practices by typing:
"<c>practice <discipline> <# of practices><z>"

Since you're a thief, type this while with your trainer:
<c>practice thief 3<z>

This will use three of your practices in the thief discipline.  
Use about half your practices at this trainer and save the other 
half for your other basic trainer.

To return to Aunt Dee, type "<c>goto dee<z>" and it will 
give you directions.

Flipping through the volume, the pages start to crumble and sort of melt
on your fingers into a slightly damp paste.  Carefully, using a gentler touch 
to turn the pages, you notice the damage done by the mildew.  The small 
elegant writing is covered over with the dark spidery mold.  On a few pages 
in the middle, where there is less damage you find some words, but some are 
indecipherable.


This day began much like any other.  The early call to break our fast after
a night   dreamless sleep. This day, on our way to the noon meal, I chanced
see a visitor talking in the great hall near the libr  y.  I wished that I
could have been close  enough to hear     news, but the water-mag     just
behind        she br oks    dalliance.


I grow tired of      endless study, though     practice is fun.   rather
funny this noon when a      handsome      mage who is new to my clas  set a

fire  ll on the heels of the master earth-mage,     is so forgetful I think
he thought he had done it hims lf.
Tomorrow I hope


perhaps I can manage to sit near him

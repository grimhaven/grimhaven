Chapter 6:  Signing up.

   All events will be scheduled and will involve pre-registration.  There
will of course be last minute sign-ups allowed if there is space still
available in an event.  We are MUDders after all and don't fit into square
holes.  However, every participant is expected to at least read the event
descriptions and come generally prepared to participate.  General
Questions can be posted and will be answered on the Tournament board. 
Specific questions and signups will be accomplished by <h> mail
addressed to "Fay", the tournament organizer.  All mail will be 
acknowledged so if you do not receive an acknowledgement please send mail 
again.

How do I remove something in the dark?
--------------------------------------

While you do need to be able to see an object on your body in order to
remove it by name: "remove glove", "remove sword", you are able to
remove whatever it is you are wearing on your "hand" simply because you
know where your hand is.  Logical, no?

To do this though, use the following syntax:
remove (slot-name)

eg:
remove head
remove waist
remove hand-left        <-- for gloves
remove leg-right
remove hold-right       <-- for weapons/shields

You should be able to remove some weapon, then hold your lantern and light it.
This will hopefully make it no longer dark.

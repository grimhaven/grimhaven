The center of the map depicts the Sympathian Mountains and the ancient 
Malithean mines.  Surrounding the mountain chain is a forest to the
north, another to the northwest, and a prominent town to the east.  Leading
through the mountains is a road outlined in red that leads far to the west.
At the west end of the road is a city.  Large arrows overlay the map,
extending from the eastern town, through the mountains, out toward the
western city.  A large star is placed in the center of the northwestern
forest.  There is some writing on the map, but you are unable to read it
as it is inscribed in the orcan language.

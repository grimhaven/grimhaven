General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN: aftermath

On the dwarf side, fully 85% of the four warlord groups had been destroyed by
the offensive magik.  Three of the warlords lay dead, and a fourth had been
struck a blow that left him unconscious (he would die some weeks later never
having regained consciousness).  The first tunneling group led by Skandar 
GoldTooth that had hit bedrock had broken through sufficiently late in the
attack to realize the tide of battle had turned, and Skandar had held the
majority of his forces back while also organizing the general retreat.  Being
the only warlord left and more importantly, the only one with a sizable force
at his command, Skandar GoldTooth was crowned first High Darmok of the dwarven
peoples, and promptly led them away lest his retreat turn into a rout.

The Elves for their part had suffered tremendously as well.  A large number
of Drow warriors had sacrificed themselves in the defense, worse, the untrained
had been slaughtered and as they represented the young, were a terrible loss.
Too, some nine of the High Ones had been killed in all, bringing their
remaining numbers to six living.  Despite the losses, the spirits and morale
was high, and it was only by calling a Full Council that the High Ones stopped
the remaining Drow from attacking the fleeing dwarves.

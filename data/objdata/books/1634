General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE RETURN OF THE FAERIES

Although long forgotten, the Faeries had not forgotten their departed kin
on The World.  They too had gone through a cataclysmic period far separated
from those we have described.  A overly simplistic treatment would categorize
what had befallen the Faeries as a civil war regarding how to handle the Elf
situation.  This is a rather poor choice of words, for the concept of violence
was unpalatable to a race that lived for Eons upon Eons.  Likewise, any combat
between creatures who molded reality as quickly and perfectly as thought
allowed would be rather short.  In truth, what had happened was something close
to a moral debate with the prize being leadership of the Council of Elders.

Indeed, a great rift occurred amongst the Faeries at the time when civilization
was deep in the morass of the Black Age.  The old Elders had lost the debate
long ago, so the decision was not over whether interference should occur, it
was over what form the interference should be of.

And when the debate was concluded and the Faeries once again of one mind, they
set the final plan into action.  Their magical reserves had grown back somewhat
in the 15 millenniums since unleashing the Dwarves.  With the stalemate The
World was in, the time was ripe for the Faeries to reestablish their presence,
and so the Fourth Age of The World began.

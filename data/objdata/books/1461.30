Advanced Action: checkuntoggle
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       checkuntoggle <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

Checkuntoggle is used to check for the absence of a given quest-toggle
before performing additional actions.  Actions after the checkuntoggle are
only performed if the performer does not have the given toggle bit set. 
Otherwise, the subsequent actions are ignored.  If the bit is set, the
other responses the mob has will be compared to allow 1 trigger to have
separate actions based on presence of quest bits (you would need multiple
response blocks set up though). 

Note: This action is deprecated!  In a properly designed quest, you should
not need to determine if a toggle is *NOT* set.

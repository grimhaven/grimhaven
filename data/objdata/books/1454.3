The zonefile consists of the header (previous chapter), a long list of
commands, and the EOF marker.

In short, your file will look like the following with all your zone 
instructions substituted in for <command>.  There is no limit to the  
size of your file or the number of elements you can build into your zone.

#<number>
<name>
<room> <lifespan> <reset> <enabled>

<command>
<command>
.
.
.
<command>
S

The 'S' at the end of the zonefile is critical as it marks the end of file
(EOF marker).  Please remember to have it and make sure all the commands in
your zone are between the header and the EOF.

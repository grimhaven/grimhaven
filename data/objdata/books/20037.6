NEWBIE BATTLE ROYALE:  Exactly the same as the Battle Royale contest mentioned
in chapter 5, except everyone has to use a level 1 newbie. If your main PC's
name is Phenohol than naming your newbie something like PhenoholII,
SuperPhenohol, PhenoholTheSecond, PhenoholStrikesBack, etc would probably be
best. Since total kills and level total of kills are obviously going to be the
same, a prize will only be given for one of these categories.  
Contestants will meet at the Challenge Events Contestants Lounge in the 
area above Grimhaven Center Square at the appointed time unless otherwise 
posted.

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF REMORSE:

As the regret the Faeries felt over causing the death of their Elven kin ran 
its course, they began to think of how to undo their mistake.  "The dwarves 
have gone bad" they said, "We must defend our kin from these dwarves."  "The 
dwarves were a mistake; we will do better this time."

And so, the Faeries set about creating a new race to act as defenders of the 
Elves.  They gave their new creation as many of their own qualities as they 
could - great magikal power coupled with a solidarity of the group 
consciousness, for these they rationalized were their own greatest strengths.  
To this they added intense wisdom, for they assumed it would be needed to 
outwit the dwarves and to survive in The World.  And lastly they inserted as 
much of the dwarven strength of character and constitution as they could 
muster.  And this new creation they named Gnomes and charged them with the 
defense of their kin.

But the Faeries had done too good a job of instilling wisdom in the Gnomes,
for the Gnomes instantly realized the futility in taking sides.  They opted 
the course of neutrality and set themselves to the task of multiplying and 
to surviving.

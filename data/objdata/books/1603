General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF GROWTH

But the rift had profound results on both sides.  The Faeries were of one
people and their powers were entwined both with each other and with The World.
Stripping the powers from the First Tribe had weakened the Faerie folk and
worse had weakened the powers inherent to The World.  With both lessened in
strength, the Faeries realized difficulties of their own.  Their powers were
not as great, nor as far reaching, and slowly they realized that exile
was not a viable option.

Meanwhile, the First Tribe was having stunning advancements.  Having decided
to forsake their magikal powers they concentrated on their natural forms.
With what was left of their powers, they explored a previously unknown and
forbidden realm by taking on the forms of the flora and fauna they found
around them.  What powers they had left flourished, although no longer could
they perform with merely a thought.  In time, The First Tribe became the
Tribes, and as the powers grew further and the shapes they chose more
permanent, the Tribes became known as the Elves.  Sixteen bands of Elves
dotted The World claiming ownership of the lands, seas and sky when The
Elders presented themselves to their prodigal brethren for the first time
since the rift.

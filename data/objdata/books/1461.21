Advanced Action: special
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       special <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

Special is used to cause the response to hand control over to a hard coded
event (special response) handler.  What the special does depends on what 
<number> is sent.  Please check with the LOW and/or a coder before setting
up a "special" in your responses.

The main use of special is to allow for things that the standard response
actions do not handle to occur.

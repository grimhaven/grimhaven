General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF DISCORD:

@^@^ "Return at once!" proclaimed the grouped mind of The Elders.

But the Elves had grown so far from their Faerie forefathers that the command
that had been thought at them went unnoticed.  "Return NOW!" commanded the
Faeries, but the demand went unheard as the Elves lacked the ability to hear 
it, let alone respond to it.

*^*^ "They ignore us" concluded The Elders, "We must force them to come back".
^&^& "We have never forced our will on our own kind, what you ask can not be 
      done."
*^*^ "But so long as they are not with us, they are not our kind, force them to
      return" countered the grouped sentience of the Faeries.
^&^& "This is true, it must be done for all our sakes." concluded The Elders.

With their first demand ignored (although unknowingly) by the Elves, the
Faeries set about performing their first original actions in a thousand
millennium.  They theorized that if the natural world in which the Elves 
now dwelled was inhospitable, they would have no choice but to return to 
the safety of the Faerie realm.  Unwilling to alter the environment for

best thing, starting a conflict...

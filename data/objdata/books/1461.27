Advanced Action: toggle
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       toggle <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

toggle will set quest-toggle <number> on the performer.  Quest-toggles are
hard coded so talk with a coder before using this command.  The toggle command
will verify that the bit is being toggled by the proper mob to avoid 
mistoggling.

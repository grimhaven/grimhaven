General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
AFTERMATH OF THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR: 

Meanwhile, the Elves had problems of their own.  "High Ones", they said,
turning to the leadership of their oldest members now that The Skye Elves
had been lost, "let us use our powers and purge this scourge that threatens
us all!"  "Destroy these vermin with your magik!" they demanded.

_._. "We came into The World to get away from our powers, not to use them 
      whenever a problem presents itself." countered the council of High Ones.
_._. "If we resort to magik now then all that we have achieved is meaningless.
      We must meet this threat as we have all others - with our natural 
      abilities.  Let us instead train our own best to counter these dwarves
      and beat them at their own game."

And so the strongest and bravest Elf hunters left their Tribes and formed a
new one.  This New Tribe trained to defeat the dwarves, learning their
ways and how to defeat them.  They practiced in the art of war and learned
to live and fight under the earth, that they could battle the dwarves on their
own ground.  And in time this New Tribe became known as the Drow and they
became the defenders of the Elves.

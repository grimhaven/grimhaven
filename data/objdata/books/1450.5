Exits:

*** WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make an exit between rooms creates
both sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  SEE 
NOTES BELOW. *********************************************************

Most of the rooms you build will have simple Euclidean exits and doors
made with the REDIT room editor or the edit command.  These tools allow
you to make simple and not so simple exits and doors between rooms. 
Making good and thoughtful exits is one of the most important aspects of
good zone building.  The main thing to realize is that <h>'s code gives
you a lot of options in selecting exits.  Do not pin yourself down to
something till you have looked at all of them. 

The first thing you should do is have practice rooms assigned to you and
start using the REDIT editor.  Typing "REDIT" will put you into a menued
room editor.  Looking through the REDIT menus is probably the best way to
learn the room and exit options available to you.  Do not use edit till 
after you have familiarized yourself with REDIT and can fix any errors you 
have made in The World.

Most of REDIT is self explanatory.  The REDIT menus allow you to build
without doors, to build secret, locked, or pick-only doors, or to make
gates, portcullis's and a variety of other door types.  Following the
different menus you will be able to assign weights, keys, keywords,
directions, and decide whether you want the door pick-able or bash-able. 
Currently, ward doors are not open-able so should not be used.  Keywords on
doors will be used by players so make them reasonable.  Other options,
such as gravity rooms, teleporters, and portals will be described
elsewhere but should be thought of as alternative exit types. 


NOTES:

WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make an exit between rooms creates both
sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  Although
this feature is useful in building a zone, it can cause problems when 1)
you make a mistake and open an unintended exit to The World or 2) you make
an exit between dissimilar room types.  If you make a mistaken exit, fix
the room flags and exits in both the room you were in and the room you
made an exit too.  If you are uncertain, ask a higher level immortal to
help or leave a note.  Please try not to leave weird room flags in world. 
Mortals get pissed when The World is not as they expected. 


USUAL BUILDING ERRORS:
 
               1. Builders forget to check room flags on both sides of exit
               2. Builders make exits to void
               3. Builders forget to name Doors
               4. Builders don't explore all exit options

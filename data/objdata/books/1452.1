Name

This is probably THE most confusing field on monsters so please be sure you
read carefully in order for things to work properly.

The name field is used internally in order to reference the creature.  This
means that if you type "hit balrog", it looks for a match of "balrog" in the
creature's name field.  However, the text shown (external use) comes from the
short description (see below).

The name field should be a space separated list of keywords for the mob.
DO NOT include words like "a", "an", "the", "of" etc.
DO NOT add punctuation.  Drop any quote marks, dashes, etc.
DO NOT capitalize any word, except proper names.
DO NOT include words that are abbreviations of other keywords already listed.
If the mob is "the merchant's wife", its name should be "wife merchants" ("the"
should be dropped, and "merchant" is an abbreviation of merchants).

Additionally, the first keyword is sometimes used externally.  It is
important that the first keyword identify the creature from those that will
be around it to avoid player confusion.  For instance, if I am making elves,
I would make "wife elven elf", "male elven elf", "husband elven elf", etc.
(note that "elf" is not an abbreviation of "elven", so is necessary in this
case).  In such situations, "wife", "male" and "husband" will be shown which
is clearer than "elf", "elf" and "elf" if I had chosen some other order.

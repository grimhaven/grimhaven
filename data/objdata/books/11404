Fortunately, the parchment is written in the Common Language, so you are
able to decipher it.  It reads:

Communique to our High Leader:
 
I regret to inform you that the recent earthquake has been more severe
than initially thought.  Our secret entrances, painstaking as they were
to create, have been damaged to the point that we receive outside incursions
daily.  We are losing troops and equipment.
 
I do not believe that we have the strength to continue our subversive
activities in the area and would like your consent to move my force back
to our forest stronghold.  If Logrus was more willing to back our triple
alliance with force, I might feel differently, but as it is, we must leave.

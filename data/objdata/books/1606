General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
PRELUDE TO THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR: 

At the time the war started, the Elves numbered some three hundred thousand
broken into sixteen tribes.  Of the original 160 High Ones that had come into
The World, some 45 remained, the rest having transformed themselves into forms
more capable of survival and unable or unwilling to return to their original
forms.

The Faeries had unleashed 32 Dwarves initially, and the Dwarves had spent
their time multiplying, learning the art of metallurgy in order to produce
tools and weapons, and discovering ways to slip in unnoticed on their much
more sensitive foes.  On the eve of the first battle, there were an estimated
1000 Dwarves armed with simple iron blades and skilled at tunneling.

The battle of Turing Heights as it later became known was little more than a
massacre.  Having tunneled directly under the Skye Elves village, the Dwarves
broke through the surface and butchered the unsuspecting, undefended and
unprepared Tribe.  The Skye Elves had been the largest Tribe, having had the
most direct link to The First Tribe.  Of the thirty thousand Elves in the
Tribe, all but sixteen were slaughtered.  More importantly, the 27 High Ones
who were part of the Tribe were also killed.  Not one Dwarf died.  News of
the massacre spread to the remaining Tribes nearly as fast as the confusion
that resulted, for The Skye Tribe (later referred to as the Lost Tribe) had 
represented the undisputed leadership of the Elves.

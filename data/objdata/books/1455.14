Automatic Character Deletion
----------------------------

<h> is rather space intensive easily requiring 70 MB of disk space
for all of the files and databases.  Obviously, we try to keep this size
in control, and one of the ways this is accomplished is by removing files
of inactive characters.

Additionally, since the <h> economy is driven by limited quantities of
equipment, it is not fair to have certain items tied up on inactive
players.

All of this requires the game maintainers to delete old characters in order
to conserve disk space and insure that items circulate.  We balance this
need with the desire of players to have their files be preserved for when
they want to play.  The following seems to be the fairest compromise:

At boottime, the mud will automatically examine how long it has been since the
character was last played.  A character is safe from deletion for level
number of days, or 1 week, whichever is more.  Hence a 4th level player has
7 days of inactivity before he will be deleted, while a 21st has 3 weeks.

Since a large number of users are from colleges, this auto deletion code
is automatically turned off between December 25th and January 15th (Christmas
Break) and between May 1st and September 15th (Summer break).

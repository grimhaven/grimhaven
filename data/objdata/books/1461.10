Action: tonotvict
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       tonotvict <string>;
       <other actions>;
     }

The tonotvict action is an advanced emote or echo command.  It will send 
<string> to everyone in room except the trigger-mob and the person performing
the trigger..  In general, any place you use a tonotvict action should also
have a tovict action so everyone sees similar things.

The beauty of tonotvict is that it allows you to use replacement characters
that will be filled in when it is actually performed based on who did the
trigger and with what.

Replacement strings:
$n  = the trigger-mobs name
$e  = "he", "she" or "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$m  = "him", "her", "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$s  = "his", "hers", "its" based on sex of trigger-mob

performer = person who triggered the action
$N  = the performer's name
$E  = "he", "she" or "it" based on sex of performer
$M  = "him", "her", "it" based on sex of performer
$S  = "his", "hers", "its" based on sex of performer

$o  = the first word in the name of the trigger-object (for give)
$p  = the full name of the trigger-object

Example:
tonotvict $n puts $s hand on $N's back.
becomes
A lazy thief puts his hand on Brutius's back.

REDIT and world creation

World.doc : Documentation for making and editing The World databases
            for <h>.

World creation is primarily done through the use of the REDIT command, although
simple changes can also be done by using the older EDIT line editor.  See
HELP EDIT for a fairly decent treatment of that command.

There's also the online web editor at

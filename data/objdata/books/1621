General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF REBALANCE:

And so it came to pass that the gnomes released their creations upon The World
and retreated to their warrens to watch how things progressed.  Many of their
creatures proved unable to survive, a few others were unstable and broke into
unexpected sub-creations.  But a good portion of what was conceived survived
and began to thrive.
 
Each new race found its own niche in nature and as the dwarves, hobbits, gnomes
and elves continued to spread, they quickly came into contact and conflict with
the new creatures.  Generations would pass and while the dwarf - elf conflict
still flared from time to time, for the most part they and the other major
races were content to just get on with life and push back the wilderness.
 
In this, the gnomes celebrated their success.  For they had succeeded in
de-escalating the faerie-kin conflict by causing the two races to worry more
about the creatures around them, then the distant enemy.
 
Within a few dozen generations, the landscape had settled into a loose, new
equilibrium.  Every nook and cranny was populated with some sort of creature,
thriving and competing with its neighbors for dominance or survival.  But it
would not be long before something else would appear to disturb the balance.

<d>Chapter 2 <1>

Policies Concerning:

      <b>The Cult of Logrus- <1>

We the Brethren of the Holy Order, 
wish to let the doctrines of the 
<b>Cultists <1> speak for themselves :

<y>1) <1><d>Concerning Self Improvement : <1>
<b>through conflict, <1> implacable drive to improve oneself, 
and accumulation of all forms of strength, <b>that the plight of <1>
<b>men and women everywhere would improve. <1>

<y>2) <1><d>Concerning their Doctrine : <1>
in the year 413, the <b>Logrus Master Aeschylus began to preach a <1>
<b>disturbing new doctrine <1>

<b>Tokain disbanded the council of priests within the cult, <1>
<b>executing those whom he deemed disloyal to Logrus, <1>
<b>and appointed a new Logrus Master. <1>
This new Logrus Master <b>burnt the treatises of Aeschylus, <1>
<b>and wrote some new doctrines far more to the liking of Tokain. <1>

year 518, <b>when this new interpretation of the Way <1>
<b>was written by Logrus Master Jolusguld II. <1>

<y>3) <1><d>Concerning Pride: <1>
they had made themselves Superior by an act of Will.

<y>4) <1><d>Concerning the Treatment of Others: <1>
<b>Logrus has taught us to show contempt for our inferiors- <1>
inferiors being those not in the Cult through ignorance or weakness,
or those who have not yet improved themselves despite their
potential to do so. 
<b>It was hoped that this continual abuse might <1>
<b>provide the encouragement necessary for Inferiors to improve <1>
<b>themselves. <1>

<y>5) <1><d>Concerning the Humble: <1>
If a man was judged incapable of improving himself,
he was to be pitied, not held in contempt,
and his station in society would thereafter become immutable-
while he could not rise above his station, having proven that he
does not possess the potential to do so,
he could not sink below his current status,
as he certainly could not be weaker than he has been already
observed.

<y>6) <1><b>indulging our Superiors. <1>

<y>7) <1><d>In reference to the Order of <r>Snakes <1>: <1>
<b>Use these pathetic fools, show them your contempt, and toss <1>
<b>them aside. <1>
   
      <d>In reference to the Knighthood: <1>
<b>ideals as 'Truth, Justice, and Beauty'  <1>
<b>is an example of a decadent society, <1>
<b>which coddles the weak emphasizing <1>
<b>the highly over-valued virtue of personal liberty <1>

<y>8) <1><d>Concerning their leaders: <1>
Logrus, the Enlightened One, left us with a successor;
<b>nearly his equal in power, if not in wisdom. <1>
His successor was the Arch Vampire.
<b>Although mighty, the Arch Vampire had none of the wisdom, <1>
<b>strength of will, or understanding of his fellow man that made <1>
<b>Logrus a great leader. <1>

Bishop Seklor, after he was given the dread gift of undeadth,
agreed with this, causing both the political position of Grandmaster
<b>and religious position of Logrus Master to be in agreement in the
<1> <b>Doctrine of Madness. <1>
A war was fought, in which the true adherents of the Way of Logrus
showed the <d>False Grandmaster <1> we had learned the teachings
of Logrus. Through conflict, we had grow stronger,
and had driven out a truly mighty adversary.
The Arch Vampire, along with the Bishop Seklor, were branded
traitors to Logrus and exiled into a Temple to the east of a city
named in honor of the Enlightened One.

Quick Start
-----------

Although it is highly recommended that first time <h> players 
read the newbie guide thoroughly, here is a list of things to do for 
those who don't want to read the help files.

1)  Watch our new user video at http://www.sneezymud.com/Help.html

2)  Take Aunt Dee up on her offer to help.  Type "goto dee" to get
    directions.
   
3)  Wear all your equipment and wield your weapon.

4)  Find your trainers and practice.  Should you become confused and
    change your mind about help files, the best ones to consult for
    this are PRACTICE and TRAINING.  The new user video will also
    give instructions.
   
5)  For free food and drink, visit Center Square.  Type "goto cs" to
    get directions.  Drink from the fountain and type "pray" to be
    blessed with a full stomach by the statue.
   
6)  ALWAYS "consider" a mob before killing it!  This will give you a
    general idea of the mob's power relative to yours.
 
7)  If you lose your equipment, visit the welfare office for a new
    set.  Type "goto welfare" for directions.

8)  To leave the game, go to an inn and "rent".  Type "goto inn" for
    directions to the Roaring Lion Inn.
 
9)  Players marked with the (Newbie-Helper) flag are there to help
    you!  Type "who" to see a list of who is online.

10) If you feel like reading help files after all (perhaps while
    resting your character), try these for starters:
    NEWBIE
    GOTO
    CONSIDER
    TRAINING
    PRACTICE
    RULES
    TERMINAL
    PROMPT
    COLOR
    TOGGLE

    WIMPY

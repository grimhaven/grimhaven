           <d>The Second Book of Vangard <1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>The Logrus Master had grown strong during these decades
of persecution and tyranny,
in addition to additional support from Bertrand and his Order of Snakes,
and their Wicked Ones on high.
<y>2. <1>I prayed to Elyon that he might instruct me as to my purpose,
but my mind was left with a stupor of thought.
<y>3. <1>Jedin joined me in my first assault on the keep along with my father.
However, our full on charge was crushed quickly by the Orcish Guardsmen
and allies of the Cult and their Leader Aeschylus III.
<y>4. <1>I saw my brother fall among the filth of their city, helpless.
<y>5. <1>Enraged, I urged my horse forward at lightning speed.
<y>6. <1>Our spies had cleared the way to the Center of town. 
Sir Nuke of the Sunshadow was waiting to lead me to the vile Temple Pyramid.
<y>7. <1>Armed with all my mind could think of,
yet alone with only a handful of Paladins,
we charged forth to that Rectory of Death.
<y>8. <1>My preparations were not enough nor was my power.
My friends were held from assisting save their holy calls for my well being.
Their prayers alone enabled me to survive as long as I did.

<y>9. <1><d>"O Elyon, have mercy and spare my life, <1> 
<d>that I may be an instrument in thy hands <1>
<d>to save and preserve this people!" <1>

<y>10.<1> My body fell limp, and there was darkness.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1><c>"My son, why hast thou come here?" <1>

<y>2. <1><d>"I know not m'lord..." <1>

<y>3. <1><c>"Look," <1>

<y>4. <1>And I looked and beheld The World upon which I was created.
I beheld also the inhabitants there on,
even all the inhabitants of The World.
<y>5. <1>Yea, and their numbers were great even as the sands of the seas.

<y>6. <1><d>"Please tell me why were these created and how?" <1>

<y>7. <1><c>"By my Spirit Children, <1>
<c>the fairies have I hereto for formed them, <1>
<c>and for a wise purpose that remaineth in me" <1>

<y>8. <1><c>"For I am Elyon, and I alone shalt thou worship. <1>
<c>Yea except thou callest upon me in prayer <1>
<c>thou shalt not receive strength. <1>
<y>9. <1><c>For there are other deities that will seek <1>
<c>to destroy and tempt you Vangard. <1>
<y>10.<1> <c>Even they will seek to rend thy body even as this one has done. <1>
<y>11.<1> <c>Yea and I said I would come to thee again and so it is. <1>
<y>12.<1> <c>You will reform the Holy Order which teacheth men to do good; <1>
<y>13.<1> <c>Learn obedience, sacrifice and faith for thus only <1>
<c>will they be worthy servants. <1>
<y>14.<1> <c>Learn the wisdom of the Prophets, <1>
<c>especially that of my servant Galek. <1>
<y>15.<1> <c>Unite the Knighthood that they may shine forth unto The World <1>
<c>and prepare the people thereon." <1>

<y>16.<1> <c>"Now, return to them and do as I have spoken. <1>
<y>17.<1> <c>For this is my work and my glory.  Even so." <1>

<y>Chapter 3 <1>
 
<y>1. <1>And it came to pass that when I awoke I had forgotten all else
save that commandment from Elyon to reform, in its purity,
the Knighthood of the Holy Order
under the laws and guidance given by the Prophets of old.

The 'T' command
Trap a chest or door

This command is atypical in terms of format so be careful.
An if_flag of 0 means trap a door, otherwise it traps the last referenced
object.  Remember to trap both sides of a door (2 zone commands).

T 0 <room with door> <dir> <type> <damage>
T 1 <type> <damage>

<type>:
#define DOOR_TRAP_POISON  1
#define DOOR_TRAP_BLADE   2
#define DOOR_TRAP_SLEEP   3
#define DOOR_TRAP_TNT     4
#define DOOR_TRAP_SLASH   5
#define DOOR_TRAP_FIRE    6
#define DOOR_TRAP_ACID    7
#define DOOR_TRAP_DISEASE 8

<damage>
The amount of damage the trap causes in multiples of d8.  ie, if you enter "4"
your trap will cause 4d8 damage.  You are only allowed to enter whole numbers
and the d8 is fixed.

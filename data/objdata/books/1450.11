Simple Doors:

*** WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make a door between rooms creates
both sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  SEE 
NOTES BELOW. *********************************************************

You will make doors in the REDIT editor or with the edit command.  Please 
familiarize yourself with REDIT before you play with the edit command 
(mostly so that you can fix anything you cause).
 
The doors portion of the REDIT editor is easy to get to and for the most
part self-explanatory. However, you will encounter some menu items that
may not be immediately clear: name, weight, condition, wards, keys. Door
type. 

Door Name: This is the "name" of the door.  It will be used in conjunction
with the doortype in setting the command to manipulate the door.  Most of 
your doors will be named "door" so that players will type "open door".  
If you want more than one name to open the door, you can add names.  Make 
sure the first word is the one you want echoed to room.  For example 
naming a door "door iron" will cause player to open door when he types 
open iron.  Naming it "iron door" will cause him to open iron.  It is 
recommended that you use "door" as the first keyword.

Door type: Play around with these. For the most part these affect the 
text players will see when they open and shut the door.  For example if 
you use gate, the door will unlatch rather than open.  If you need a new 
doortype, talk to Batopr or the LOW.

Weight:  Door weight is related to the player strength attribute.  The
weight of the door determines what strength is required to open the door. 
For the most part up to weight=15 it is linear (i.e. a pc with strength=14
can not open a door which you have set to 15).  After this the formula
changes somewhat.  Please be thoughtful about making heavy doors.  In
addition, although maybe coded in future, players can not at this time
pool their strengths on a door so the max weight you should set on any
door would be 19. 

Key Number: If you make a locked door, you will encounter "Key Number". 
This refers to the database number (vnum) of the key you will be making to
open the door.  Only a key with that vnum will open the door.  You will
make the key later but should assign it a number now.  You should use the
number of the room for the key for simplicities sake.  For example, if
your zone is rooms 1900-2100 and you are building a locked door from 1954
to 1955, you should use key number 1954 or 1955.  Be aware that you will
have to use this same number later when you make your objects. 

Other options: You have a number of other exit choices available to you
other than the simple exits you can make in the room editors.  If you have
an object in the room which will be the same keyword as the door itself,
you should see the LOW to get a unique door type made for that room.  In
addition, subject to the availability of a coder, you can make word doors
or have special room/exit procedures coded if you have an interesting door
idea and a coder is willing to undertake the project. 

Using the edit command:  After you have explored your options and have
become comfortable with using the REDIT room editor, you might want to
explore the edit command. The edit command is usually used by experienced
builders to make exits fast without having to go through REDIT menus.  Do
not use this command till you are comfortable with REDIT and can fix any
problems you create using the edit command.  There is help edit to help
you learn this command. 

Teleport Rooms: The edit command is also the only way you can make
teleport rooms which are another exit option.  Teleport rooms are
described later in this book.  The other options you have for exits are to
make a room only reachable by magic spells or reachable by flying,
climbing, swimming, or water-breathing players. 

NOTES:

WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make a door to a room creates both sides
of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  Although this
feature is useful in building a zone, it can cause problems when 1) you
make a mistake and open an unintended exit to The World or 2) you make an
exit between dissimilar room types.  If you make a mistaken exit, fix the
room flags and exits in both the room you were in and the room you made an
exit too.  If you are uncertain, ask a higher level immortal for help or
leave a note.  Please try not to leave weird room flags in world.  Mortals
get pissed when The World is not as they expected. 

OTHER CHAPTERS:  Later in this book, you will see chapters on doors, 
secret doors, and teleport rooms that will give some further details.


USUAL BUILDER ERRORS:
               1. Builders forget to check room flags on 
                  both sides of exit
               2. Builders make exits to void
               3. Builders forget to name Doors
               4. Builders don't explore all exit options

Use the "goto" command to find your class trainer by typing:
"<c>goto trainer<z>"

Follow the directions until you are standing in the same room 
with your class trainer.

Once you're there, use some of your practices by typing:
"<c>practice <discipline> <# of practices><z>"

For example, if you are a warrior, type this while with your trainer:
<c>practice warrior 3<z>

This will use three of your practices in the warrior discipline.  Use about
half your practices at this trainer and save the other half for your other 
basic trainer.

To return to Aunt Dee, type "<c>goto dee<z>" and it will give you directions.

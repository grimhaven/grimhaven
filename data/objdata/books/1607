General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR: 

When news of the massacre at Turing Heights reached the Faeries, their confusion
was pronounced.  "What have we done?" they asked The Elders.  But The Elders
had no answer to give and so the Faeries wept.  Their Tears fell toward The 
World, and where the Tears struck the earth, lesser faeries - dryads, naiads,
satyrs, pixies and nymphs sprang forth.  Because the Tears were of sorrow, what
sprang from the Tears would be eternally optimistic and happy.  Because the
Tears were shed by Faeries who would never forget their folly, their faerie
offspring would be unable to remember a thing.

It is also said that when the Dwarves saw their Faerie masters crying, they
became enraged.  "Is this not what we were supposed to do?" asked the Dwarves.
"Why do they weep for these Elves and cast us down?" they wondered.  The
Dwarf leaders came to realize how little their Faerie creators respected
them, and vowed never to follow their lead again.  They cast off their name
and became known as dwarves.  At the same time, their single purpose of
harassing the Elves changed into a general hatred for all things of the
Faeries.  The dwarves caught some of the Faerie Tears as they fell and planted
them deep within their tunnels.  Here the magik of The World metamorphosed
the Tears into brilliant diamonds and other precious minerals.  Because these
substances reminded them of their betrayal and embarrassment, the dwarves
sought these minerals out.

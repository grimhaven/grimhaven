Building: Objects

The easiest way to create an object is to load one that is similar to what
you want and modify it.

To see a list of existing objects in the world, use SHOW OBJECT <obj>. For
example:
	show obj sword
	show obj table

To modify the equipment you have two options:
	a. Using the CGI object editor located at
http://www.sneezymud.com/cgi-bin/objeditor.cgi (not IE compatible);
	b. Using the OEDIT editor.

The editor has the handy ability to clone objects from existing objects in 
the world. In the vnum box enter the number under which the new objects will
be saved (should be within your zone range number) and in the template box
enter the number of object you're cloning. And start editing!

To use the OED editor in game, a few more steps are required.

Load an object similiar to what you want using LOAD OBJ <obj>, where <obj>
can either be the object's name or vnumber. For example:
	load obj long-sword
	load obj 300

Before you modify it though, save the object in your OED directory. To do
so, type OED SAVE <obj> <vnum>, where <vnum> is the number under which the
object will be saved. It should be a number within your zone range numbers.
For example:
	oed save sword 1111

To use the OEDIT editor, first load the object you just saved to modify it.
Type OED LOAD <vnum>, where <vnum> is the number used to save the object.
For example:
	oed load 1111

Then type OED MODIFY <obj> to go into the editor screen. Make the changes
you want, and when you're done and you're out of the editor screen, save
your work with OED RESAVE <obj>.

TIPS
------------
Read the OEDIT editor book, even if you are using the CGI utility. They
are available in the bookshelf in the Builder's Lounge (room 2).

Make sure you save items like chest closed. And if they are lockable,
lock them before you save.

OED AVERAGE is a handy way to adjust an equipment's level/damage. Check
out the help file. You can also use the equipment calculator in
http://www.sneezymud.com/cgi-bin/eqcalc.cgi.

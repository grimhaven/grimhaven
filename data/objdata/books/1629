THE THIRD ELF - DWARF WAR

That is not to say that all was peaceful and good in The World.  Civilization
required increasing amounts of contact between the diverse groups.  Hatreds
millennium old slowly but surely came back to the surface.  And worse, these
old insults were compounded by perceived slights when trade deals didn't prove
to be as profitable as originally thought.  Civilization was a two-edged sword. 
It brought about great advancements but required increased contact with others
to achieve it.  There was a dark side to this contact that would boil over.

The racial skirmishes of old had gradually turned into small raids on each
others trade.  Then slowly they became attacks on anyone trying to trade with
the enemy.  Next came the trade sanctions various enclaves set up.  Entire
villages refused to accept the products of other races villages or even deal
fairly with them.  Complicating the matters, they would set up double standards
on goods for those that refused to support them.  Human traders increasingly
found themselves asked if they carried elven wares when entering dwarven
villages.  Those that answered yes often found themselves unwelcome or offered
uncompetitive prices.  Elves reciprocated and a bitter trade war commenced.

Caravans were destroyed, trade routes laid waste and entire regions cut off in
vicious sieges.  Parties that had had no interest in the war found themselves
caught up in it by association with one member or another.  Worse still, the
conflict spawned intraracial strife as allies of one side found other villages
allied to the other side.

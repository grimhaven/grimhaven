                               for those that can't find a group or have 
			       a partial group formed.  Those who
                               enter on that list will be appointed a group
                               upon gametime, but only if possible. If
                               there is a remaining person, that person may 
                               not play unless they find a group. 
                               Appointments are made in order down the list; 
                               First come, first serve.
			       Death disqualifies you.
			       Group Level Limit: 80 upon signup

GROUP ELIMINATION TOURNAMENT:  A challenge event in which groups of 4 or
more PC's will duel to their deaths in a small arena pit.  All challenges
will be between groups of PC's of the same approximate total level.  The
challenges events will continue in heat fashion until there is a winner
and a runner-up.  Each heat lasts until everyone in a particular group has
been killed. Deaths will not involve experience gains or losses and their
will be no looting of corpses.  Players may choose their competing
characters from any of their existing PC's but may run only one character
per group.  Any class may participate in this event.  Each group must
contain at least 4 PC's and is restricted to 80 total levels.  All
competitors will meet at the Challenge Events Contestant's Lounge in the
area above Grimhaven Center Square unless another place is designated on
the Tournament Board or by mail.  Because of level limits within groups,
PC's may assign their prizes to their main character even if that
character is of a higher level. At time of pre-registration the total
levels of the 4+ group members may not exceed 80.

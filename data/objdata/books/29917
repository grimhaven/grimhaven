           <d>The Duties of an Elder <1>
      <d>In the Knighthood of Melchizedek <1>

      
The voice of <c>Elyon <1> came unto me saying,

<d>"O ye Elders of Galek hearken now unto these words. <1>
<d>It is has been given unto you all that is mine, <1>
<d>ye but have to search.  Seek therefore and ye shall <1>
<d>find, knock and it may be opened unto you.   <1>
<d>For ye are the meat of mine house.   <1>
<d>See that my people are taught more perfectly,  <1>
<d>and have experience, and know more perfectly  <1>
<d>concerning their duty, and the things which I  <1>
<d>require at their hands.  <1>
<d>Continue to reveal unto them true nature <1>
<d>of the doctrine of Galek and that of the Prophets  <1>
<d>throughout the ages.  Lead all thine meetings as <1>
<d>directed by me for I will speak words unto thee. <1>
<d>Yea and I will give unto thee according to that <1>
<d>which I have said and that which I will yet reveal. <1>
<d>And never wilt the right hand offend the left. <1>
<d>For my words are eternal and unchanging. <1>
<d>Yea, it is only thine understanding which changes. <1>
<d>Be ye therefore Perfect in thine understanding." <1>

Encompassing all Aaronic duties, An <d>Elder <1> of the 
Knighthood of Melchizedek now is given the fullness of
the Knighthood.  You are to exemplify all that a Knight
is and should be.  An <d>Elder <1> is to teach the
<d>Eyes of Elyon <1> to the people with power and
authority from the great creator, <d>Elyon <1>.  You are
to be bold in denouncing immorality and wickedness.  For
that is thy primary concern to minister of the spiritual
well being of the <d>Holy Order <1> .

<d>Elders <1> of the <d>Holy Order <1>  are to be 
responsible for the <d>Home Teaching Program <1> of the
Knighthood.  The Home Teaching Program is thus; All
Knights are to be assigned a Home Teacher.  The Home
Teacher is to watch over that individuals needs both
temporally as well as spiritually.  They are to be a
friend and confidant.  A Home Teacher is to know when
there is <d>financial stress either monetarily <1>
<d>or in the realm of personal needs. <1>
Then their duty is to <d>report such needs to the <1>
<d>Apostle of Welfare <1> , and, pending his evaluation,
<d>receive assistance to bestow <1> upon his home teacher. 
Once a month a Home Teacher is to share a short message
with their assignment from either the <d>Eyes of Elyon <1>
or the other printed material of the Knighthood.  
<d>Elders <1> are to be assigned to all members of the
Knighthood regardless of office.  
Know your home teaching assignments brethren, this is
the most crucial of all knighthood responsibilities.
In this manner the needs of members shall be 
accommodated and we may all learn service, sacrifice and
love.

<d>Elder <1>s of the <d>Holy Order <1> are to <d>ordain <1>
worthy Aaronic Knights to the <d>Melchizedek <1> 
<d>Knighthood only after the sustaining vote <1> of the
Brotherhood is attained.  If there are any opposed the
matter must be discussed and pondered till a unanimous
decision can be attained.  After extending the calling
to a particular office within the <d>Holy Order <1> , an
<d>Elder <1> must then insure his or her willingness to
continue to serve others both within and without the
Order, as well as <d>sustain the Edicts of Faith <1> 
<d>and Tenets of Membership <1> .  Once sure of the
sincerity and intent of an individual, and if ordaining
to the office of an <d>Elder <1>, with the approval of the
Melchizedek body of Knights, an <d>Elder <1> may then
ordain him or her to an office appropriate to not only
their level of experience, but also their degree of
faith.
It may be necessary for a Knight to proceed through
offices normally held by those of younger nature in
order to better prepare for the fullness of the 
Knighthood.  When Knighting another a <d>Elder <1> should
call that person by naming asking them to kneel;  Assure
that they have <d>read, understand and will commit to <1>
<d>the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of Membership; <1>
Laying ones hands or holy blade upon either the Head (if
by hand) or the right shoulder (if by sword) and stating
ones authority as a <d>Elder <1> in the <d>Holy Order <1> 
of Melchizedek, knight the individual to his or her
appropriate sphere (whether it be Melchizedek if
ordaining as an <d>Elder <1> or Aaronic for all other 
callings), as well as ordain them to a 
corresponding office within that sphere of the Order . 
Then as directed by their feelings pronounce words of
encouragement and upliftment welcoming them into the
Knighthood.  These ceremonies will be the source of
great excitement and rejoicing in the lives of many. 
Strive to assure they are spiritually motivating and
reverent.

Finally, <d>Elders <1> must preside over all joint
meetings of the Knighthood recognizing Apostles if
present.  They are to conduct and also speak to the body
of the Knights of Melchizedek.  <d>Elders <1> are to gain
direction from the Quorum of the 12, yet are solely
responsible for the governing of the Knighthood body. 
<d>Elders <1> should feel free to call meetings of the
Knighthood at their discretion.

You, Brother <n>, Have been consecrated and set apart as
a father over a numerous people.  Let you faith be a
tower of strength to those whom you diligently serve.

All my love Brother,
 
Vangard Prophet of the <d>Holy Order <1>

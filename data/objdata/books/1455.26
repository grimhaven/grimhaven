Ack, I lost all my goods, what's up with that?
----------------------------------------------

Refer to HELP REIMBURSE for starters.  In general, dying just before the
game crashed or rebooted is not a valid reason to get a reimbursement
since the game will save your corpse in the same room it was in before the
crash.. If the game did not crash and you didn't die, then HELP LOSING LINK
probably explains why you have no equipment.

In any case, for item reimbursement questions,  you will need a 54+ level
god. WHO -GL to see who's on.

The other obvious alternative is that you couldn't afford your rent and
the rent contingencies as detailed in HELP RENT occurred.

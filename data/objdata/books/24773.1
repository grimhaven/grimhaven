Day 1
It seems I may have finally escaped that crazy bitch.
It almost makes me cry to think how pathetic it is that
she can't even take the time to understand her own
daughter. I'm better off far away from the stinking
Shire and it's nasty fruit. Elric's taught me plenty
enough to survive in the world. Good bye banal village
life!

Day 2
Blew up some cyclopses, left one with syphilis. Been
a good day. Not quite sure where I'm going to, but I
haven't heard the old woman for more than a full day
The silence is deafening.

Day 3
Passed the big city whence the murderous swine that
pillage our village come. Left some indelible marks 
on the city gatekeeper and moved on.

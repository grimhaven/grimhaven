General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN: part II

Alarms blaring, cries of pain from the woods around them and a yet to be seen
enemy force caused additional panic amongst the Drow.  At that moment, the
second tunnel group burst through the surface, and with a sense of timing
that would gratify any general, the ground forces broke through the tree line
and entered the Elven lines.  The battle proper began.

Drow numbers were just barely sufficient to make up for their lack of skill.
Where the dwarves had been training for war, the Drow had been training for
defense, and more specifically defense from a raid and not an army.  In the
initial waves, four Elves died for every dwarf that was struck down.

Those Drow not assaulted by the initial waves saw their kin struck down 
mercilessly.  Worse, a small group of dwarves had broken into the council
area itself, and word spread that 4 High Ones had been slain before help
arrived.  Confusion turned to anger, and anger to hatred.  Long dormant 
thoughts welled to the Faerie children's minds, and the rage of those Drow
was unleashed in full fury!  Their magikal powers, untouched for generations,
came unbidden to their minds, and while it had been weakened by long disuse,
it was more then sufficient to turn the tide of battle.

Giant swirls of magik enveloped the attacking dwarves, and tore them asunder,
destroying the invaders without mercy.  Attacked by magik with which they could
not hope to compete, there was no viable alternative for the dwarves but to
sound a retreat.

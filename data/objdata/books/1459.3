CLASSES, RACE, AND POWER

Note that, with some exceptions, any race can try to be any class, but
some of those combinations may not make good characters.  Your race gives
you a range of stats and you can only modify compared to a generic member
of your race.  Magic effect are no longer limited by racial maxes and
there are no set stat limits for multi's.  Multi-classes also have no
direct pre-reqs but will not be as powerful because of the relation of
stats to race and some of the changes to learning and fighting vs engaged
casting.  

Multi-classing has been taken out of the game although the code has not
been removed.  It is unlikely for them to come back in the game. The
intention is to add more hybrid classes in.

Hybrid classes such as Deikhan and Ranger have a number of overall
improvements that improve their playability but also are more limited as
casters now.  In fact, rangers no longer cast but have skills that border
on magic. Clerics as a whole were slightly downgraded by losing the pet
skills (put in the shaman class which will open after the mud goes into
production) and some changes to fighting/engaged casting and mages were
increased in power.  Monks and thieves were restructured.  Thieves have
new trap skills and monks are going through a pretty through change in
focus which may continue into 5.0 production.

What is <h>?
------------------

<h> is a MUD similar in some ways to other muds on the Internet.  Our
original source was SillyMUD DIKU code, but with the release of version
4.1, all original code was put in place. Version 5.0 has added a number of new
structures including full color, a new skill system and tasked spellcasting.

<h> is written in C++ and utilizes object-oriented coding techniques.
It has roughly 30 megabytes of code, 8 megabytes of database related
information and 15 megabytes devoted to the player and rent files for the
1000+ characters.  In total, more than 15000 manhours have been devoted to
creating <h> by either the half dozen implementors or by one of the 80
or 90 builders we have had since to first <h> went public in June of
1992.  There are 215000 lines of code at present.

All rights to the <h> code reside with the <h> Implementation
Team.  At present, no version of <h> code is available to the public and
all contributions become the property of the <h> Implementation Team.

<h> remains committed to bringing the Internet the best possible mud
without charge.  It runs on a machine offered to us by the great folks at 
Stanford University.  <h>'s gods volunteer their time to improving the 
mud.

Each of these fields uses what is called a bitvector.  In order to have
multiple resistances, you merely set the mob resistant to the sum of the
various resistances.  For example, to create a char this is immune to
fire (1), poison (256) and charm (2048), set immunity = 2305.  Likewise,
if susceptibility = 2305, the mob would be susceptible to fire, poison and
charm.

Note: The bit for NONMAG prevents a weapon that is not at least +1 tohit from
damaging, the PLUS1 bit prevents ONLY +1 tohit weapons from damaging, etc.

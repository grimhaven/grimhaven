Topic: checkroom
--------------------

Ex:
<block> { "<args>";
	...responses...;
	checkroom <room>;
	...responses...;
	}

<room> = Room the mobile should be in.

  This will check the script mobs current room and make sure the
current one, plus the passed <room> one, match up.  If they do not
then execution of the script is stopped.

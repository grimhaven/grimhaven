Decay time

This should be set on items that will rot or decay.  A value <0 means it
never decays.  Each decay unit corresponds to a half-tick (37.5 seconds in
a lag less world).

Decays should be set on all organic items and food.  This is a tool for 
enforcing circulation of items and can be used on magic items.

Building Policies:

Follows is a list of general rules, which the LOW has written as he comes
to it.

1.  Make robes for casters, armor for fighters
2.  Caster equipment should be lower structure than tanking gear if it
    contains mana.
3.  Mob stats are limited to 80 total.
4.  DO NOT set Immunity or Discipline to items without the LOW consent.
5.  Be consistent when setting allowed and disallowed races for a piece of armor.
	It makes no sense that a warrior can wear something a deikhan can't.

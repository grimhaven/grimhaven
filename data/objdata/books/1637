General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
LOGRUS'S PLAN

Now Logrus was a Faerie, and as such, was an undisputed master of magik.  And
thus it was rather simple for him to make some sweeping changes in how the
demihumans structured themselves.

His first task was to raise his greatest asset, the ogres, up from
mindlessness.  Into them he instilled the beginnings of sentience.  And into
the best of these, he added a knowledge of magik - thus creating the first of
the ogre-magi's.  These ogres and ogre magi's he set in charge over all the
lesser demihumans.  And so it is today, that orcs, kobolds and goblins of all
sorts look to ogres for leadership.

The ogres though were still lacking in wit.  So, from a pool of hatred deep
within The World that predated even Logrus, he congealed the first Daemons,
and these he set as masters over the ogres.

With his minions in place, Logrus set them loose upon the civilized lands
and moved on to bigger things.

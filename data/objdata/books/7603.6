How is <h> different from every other MUD?
------------------------------------------------

In the past few years, MUDs have exploded around the net.  It sometimes
seems that everyone and their brother is putting up a mud.  Unfortunately,
most of these muds are stock MUDs.  A stock MUD is a mud which was developed
by a group of experienced coders, and the source code for which was then made
publicly available.  This means that every stock mud is just like every other
stock mud in terms of code, creatures, rooms, objects, features, etc...  In
fact the only differences that really exist are in how the runners of the
games act (or handle problems) as well as the few (if any) modifications that
the mud creates for itself.

<h> was originally developed from the SillyMUD stock code (opened June
1992) making <h> a member of the DIKU (essentially a combat-oriented MUD)
family of muds.  However, unlike most stock muds, <h> made a commitment
to continued development.  In the many of its life, the mud has been
rewritten three times, once to add vastly more functionality, once to upgrade
from C to C++, and once again to add even more functionality.  This attention
to innovation can be seen in the differences between <h> and other muds.

At the same time, the libraries of mobs, objects and rooms were completely 
replaced to make use of the advanced features that had been incorporated.  
While we have maintained the "look-and-feel" of the standard DIKU mud, the 
guts of the mud are a completely different beast.

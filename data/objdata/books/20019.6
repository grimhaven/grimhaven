BEAST HUNT:   Players will gather together to confront a threat to the city,
their job is to kill whatever this threat is.  All players participating in
the battles will receive at least some reward, probably monetary.  The
monster(s) will be *very* tough and impossible to beat single-handedly. It
is designed as a group effort to promote group cooperation skills. (very
handy in the group vs. group arena battles :)  Players must defeat the
monster(s) within the time limit designated or the city is lost.  
Approved groups will meet at the Mud-Wide Contestant's lounge in the area 
above Grimhaven Center Square at the appointed time.

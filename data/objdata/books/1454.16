The 'V' command
Change an objects special values

This allows you to set different 4-values onto an object at time of loading.
The reason this is helpful is for items like windows that need to look into
various rooms dependent on where the window is.  Rather than making 5
different "windows", make one window and merely change the 4-value on each one
so that they look into 5 separate rooms.  'V' is always applied to last
object referenced.

V <if_flag> <4-value> <new value>

<if_flag> should be 1   (do not do it if obj did not load)
<4-value> should be either 0, 1, 2 or 3
<new value> is whatever new value should be

O 0 110 1 104            window
V 1 0 100                    looking into room 100

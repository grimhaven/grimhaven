Extra Description

The use of extra descriptions is what sets off mediocre builders from good
builders.  Extra descriptions are extra text that players read as they
explore the room they are in.  Usually builders build zone clues and
the heart of their zone story into their extra descriptions.  Even if you
are not telling a story or building in a quest, good zones will ALWAYS
have things to look at.  However, what sets off a good zone from a great
zone is the use of extra descriptions to tell a story and setup puzzles
for the players to solve. 

An extra description is referenced by players by typing "look at 
(x)".   Builders make them in the REDIT menu. 

Understand that you can build in layers.  You can have clues to an extra 
description in the room description and clues to additional extra 
descriptions embedded in that first extra description.  This is an
especially useful in giving out clues to secret doors.

Keywords: This is a space separated list where each word is one of the
words that is substituted for (x) above.  Players can abbreviate so you
don't need to have separate keywords for both "wall" and "walls", you should
just set up the word "walls" as a keyword.  In selecting keywords, you 
must be cognizant of what objects will be in room so that you don't embed 
a keyword behind an object making it unusable.

Extra Description Text: The text you type is what will be displayed when 
someone types look <at> keyword. 

NOTES:

RECOMMENDED/REQUIRED EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS:  You almost always should use an 
extra description in the following building situations:

   Secret Doors: You should always put at least one extra descriptions in
      a  room if you have a secret door in the room.  (See the long note 
      on secret doors at the end of this volume.) 
   Teleport Rooms: If your room is a teleport room, you can set up
      an extra description with keyword: _tele_ This text will be shown
      when the character is teleported. 


REDUNDANT KEYWORDS: You do not need both picture and pictures or wall and 
walls.  Just use the plural of all keywords.

CHECK YOUR KEYWORDS FOR BLOCKAGES:  It is possible to have keywords block
other keywords.  Room keywords can also interfere with object keywords. 
It is also possible to not leave enough hints so that players can find the
keyword.  Make sure after you build that all keywords are findable by the
player.

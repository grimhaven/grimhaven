Section 4:

Grimhaven Announces New Construction

  With Grimhaven's new prosperity due to recent agreements with the other
major cities of the Realm, a large amount of new construction has been
completed within the city.  In commemoration of all the fallen heroes who
have protected the walls of Grimhaven, and the recent loss of the
instructors of the old mage academy, a plot of land has been set aside for
a new cemetery.  Though many of the city's citizens hail this new addition
as a fitting reminder of past heroes, some have reported strange creatures
roaming the cemetery at night.  One child out past curfew was found
whimpering in a corner, claiming to have seen the dread god Shroud.  
  On a happier note, the king of Grimhaven has commissioned the erection of
Adder's Coffee House.  This upscale new addition of Grimhaven appears to
have become an unofficial haunt for merchants and businessman of all types.
The new adjoining hangout known as the Snake-pit has become a gathering
place for mercenaries and adventurers from all across the Realm.  Together,
these two new establishes may allow for easier relations among new visitors
to the city.
  Rumors have also matriculated of a new Faction Meeting Center to be built
to the west of Grimhaven.  This new meeting hall will better allow
representatives of all the factions to meet in peace.  The Herald's sources
have also heard though the grapevine that there will be tight security in
this new meeting center to protect the faction leaders and that it will be
the first step to better relations among the factions.  The King of
Grimhaven was on hand to comment, "It is our hope that with the new
construction, we shall be that much closer to achieving a peaceful unity."

History of the Tome

The Book of Power itself seems to be ancient, clearly dating back to a time
during the reign of Faeries or perhaps even before [1].  It is unclear what role
it had, or why it comes to have the magic it does today.  Despite this enigma,
Marukalia remains a great source of debate and interest in today's modern
thaumaturgic world.  After its discovery by the Proctor of Brightmoon in 664
P.S. at an excavation site, it has been the target of continuous study.

[1] Gibbons and Blake, 889 P.S.

Saving and loading rooms

The relevant commands are RSAVE and RLOAD.  (See the help files on each)
These commands have some very important features/problem areas and 
are responsible for the most common and costly builder errors.

NOTES:

OVERWRITING PREVIOUS WORK:  When you RSAVE your work, your former save
file is deleted and replaced with your new save.  This means that if you
screw up, you can and *will* easily wipe out a ton of work you have done.
The most common errors come from not saving *all* of your built rooms (See
Using a RSAVE Macro below) and trying to save a temporary building project
before the LOW has told you that your rooms have been backed up and it is
safe to save.  If the LOW gives you an assignment or you need to save
rooms that you have built *and* you have been working on a zone, do not
RSAVE these new rooms till the LOW has told you that it is safe to do so. 

USE A RSAVE MACRO:  You should ALWAYS RLOAD and RSAVE all rooms in your
zone.  <h> has on-line aliases and most people use clients.  You should
only RSAVE and RLOAD using a macro/alias that does your save or load
accurately each time so that an accidentally typo doesn't cost you.

What good is a spellbag?
------------------------
(spellbags)

Spellbags are special magical containers for components.  Since they cannot
be used to hold regular (non-components) items, they are often thought of as
being of little use.  However, they have two useful qualities.

First, they protect components from decay.  Some components go bad over time,
but the interior of a spellbag is magically shielded from the ravages of time.

Secondly, they are magically attuned to the forces of thaumaturgy.  Thus, if
a spell calls for you to hold a component in your secondary hand, you could
either keep all the components separate, attempt to remember which one you need
for a given spell and grab it at the proper time (in the thick of battle?), 
or... throw all your components in a spellbag, and when you are ready to cast
a given spell, merely grab the spellbag.  The spell will find the component
it needs within the spellbag and utilize it properly.

Extra descriptions

Used to store extra text associated with the object.  If you want something
shown when people look at (object) you must set up extra descriptions.  
This works similar to room extra descriptions except that all items 
should have extra descriptions of some kind even if it is just a sentence 
description.

The keyword is a space separated list of words used to reference the object.
ie, look at (x) where (x) must be in the extra-description's keyword list.  In
general the keywords should match the items name field.

ex:
name:  chest giant
short: a giant chest
extra desc -
  keywords: chest giant
The giant chest seems made of wood and is almost 5 feet tall.  On the front
is a brass latch.

extra desc -
  keywords: latch brass
The brass latch is as big as your arm.  It seems to conceal a small needle
with poison in it.


NOTES:

MAKE SURE YOU SET THEM: Every item should have an extra description set 
on it so players can look at the object.

CONFLICTS WITH ROOM EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS:  Make sure you check that there are no
conflicts between your item extra descriptions and your room extras.

ZERO/DELETE ALL EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE BUILDING WHEN BUILDING FROM A TEMPLATE

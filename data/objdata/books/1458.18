Leaving the Game
-------------------------

When you are ready to leave the game, find the closest inn and "rent".
In Grimhaven, you may type "goto inn" to get directions to the Roaring
Lion Inn.  Once there, type "rent" and your things will be stored for
you and your character will be saved until your next playing session.

For low-leveled players, there's little to no charge to rent.  The fee
for renting varies from city to city.

You can also leave the game by camping if you have the skill "encamp".
Once successfully camped, you type "rent" to leave the game.

Advanced players may become wealthy enough to purchase their own home
where their personal butler will perform the duties of the innkeeper,
saving the character's items and status.

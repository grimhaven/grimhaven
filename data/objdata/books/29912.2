Chapter II : Coils of the Serpent.

The First Coil: Balance

A coil as thin as a hair, as sharp as a scimitar will tip if too much is
piled on one side. Take note of this fact and thrive to balance your
actions on one side with equal actions on the other. Do not allow yourself
to be committed so deeply to one side that you cannot extract yourself.
History is full of examples on how legends have fallen when they became
too attached to profit, power and other alluring aspects of life.

The Second Coil: Strength

The python's power comes from its strong ability to crush its opponents.
without this strength, it is nothing. Learn from this, and always take
advantage of any opportunity to increase the strength of the Order. Admit
all members, for each will contribute in some small way to the strength of
the Order, but do not hesitate to cast aside someone that is detracting
from our purpose. But always remember strength without balance is nothing
but weakness.

The Third Coil: Profit

This coil is the bases of all coils. Once this coil is established, all
the other coils are based on it. Money is he strength supplied to all the
powers of the Order. This is the key that makes us, we must never be
foolish to try and attain balance and strength without the support of the
real power, and that is profit. But Profit has so many faces and lies in
so many different ways. One must always achieve the greatest profit in the
long run. Always be aware of where the balance and profit collide. Where
profit may seem better in the tilting of scales of balance, it will be
true for only a short period of time. Profit will always be greater in the
longer run and in the survival of the Order when balanced is maintained.

The Fourth Coil: Discipline

One must always achieve the peek of one self power and ability. This can
only be done through the control of the forces of order and Chaos within
oneself. Although the balance of both will not necessarily achieve the
peek in oneself, controlling both will be the key to reach Discipline.
Always control the power, always control your enemies and allies and never
let the power control you.

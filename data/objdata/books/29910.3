           <d>The Book of Ethren <1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>Oh that I had the voice of deity
and could shout the words of our Prophets
across the realm in one mighty breath!
<y>2. <1>Yea, and with a voice of thunder declare truth unto all races.
Even those ogres who have petitioned
for the brotherly bond of civilization.
<y>3. <1>Oh how glorious is the honor and morality of the Knighthood!
<y>4. <1>Were all people as such could there be any wickedness?
Nay, there could not.
<y>5. <1>I have sought to go unto all nations, races and creeds
that they mayest hear and embrace the noble words of the Prophet,
and in wisdom, see that which is just and true.
<y>6. <1>Oh that I could have my wish and stay a Crusader forever!
Yea, and for all eternity declare this message of beauty.
<y>7. <1>Yet I do not joy in my own success alone,
but my joy is more full because of my brethren
who have gone up unto the realm of the Drow,
yea and those Dwarves as well.
<y>8. <1>Behold have they not labored exceedingly?
Yea, and behold they have brought forth much fruit,
and how great shall be their reward!
<y>9. <1>Now, I think of the success of these my brethren
and my soul is carried away, for they have not only brought hundreds
to the truth but have sown peace amongst eternal hatreds.
<y>10.<1> Oh how great shall be there joy.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>Yes now the time has come for me to accept a new calling,
for our noble prophet Enochen doth wax extremely old.
Yea he doth confound even our clerics with his longevity.
Certainly he hath been prospered by the hand of that Great Creator.
<y>2. <1>Yet even great ones must pass away,
for verily this is the way of the World, that the old may be released
and the young take their place in the realm of leadership.
<y>3. <1>Now, despite my frailties I have accepted this calling,
as well as those records diligently kept and preserved
by the hand of Endralil the young.
For alas, he is no longer so young :),
and he too, even our great Apostle must too pass away.
<y>4. <1>May the prayers of the Knighthood suffer me
that I may lead them in the way of Galek.    

<y>Chapter 3 <1>

<y>1. <1>Truth is power and power is Victory.
<y>2. <1>A true leader is a man that learns to use truth
to inspire others as friends.
<y>3. <1>For Henceforth I call ye not servants,
for a servant knoweth not what his lord doeth;
but I call you friends for all that I know I make known unto you.
<y>4. <1>Brethren we must commit ourselves to the Truth
and let nothing dilute that faith;
for he that is diluted is a water from the Myrian sea to the taste.
<y>5. <1>Let not thyself be diluted for as that sea water ye must be spewn out
and trodden underfoot by those oppressors
and their abominable leader The Vampire of Logrus.
<y>6. <1>Knights you are, and sometimes we must sing alone.
<y>7. <1>For even now they are at our gates,
yea and all these cites round about
waiting to destroy and pillage the hearts of men.
<y>8. <1>Yea, I am seeing that even now our missionaries
in Grimoire Haven lieth in their blood!
<y>9. <1>Yea and they have been slain by that secret band
which was established by Thracian of Logrus!
Go now and see if it is not so!

<y>Chapter 4 <1>

<y>1. <1>In a tumult of gasps and fear the Elite guardsmen
ran straightway out of the city to see of this
which had been prophesied by that great seer Ethren.

<y>2. <1><d>"We rode all day until we came to the place of Grimoire Haven,
<d>yea we sought out, even as Ethren <1>
<d>hath spoken, the stronghold of the brethren <1>
<d>therein and they did lie their blood, <1>
<d>even as it had been testified by our Seer. <1>
<y>3. <1><d>We were astonished insomuch that we did fall to the earth; <1>
<d>and behold after we has recovered from our astonishment, <1>
<d>behold they did cast us into prison. <1>
<y>4. <1><d>Now as for the murder of these men <1>
<d>we know not who has done it; <1>
<d>and only this much do we know that we have rode and came as desired, <1>
<d>according to the words of Ethren." <1>

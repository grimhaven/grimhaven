Short Description

The short description of the object is the shortest display of text that will
be used to indicate the object.  The short description is used by the 
code to refer to objects in most situations players will encounter except 
for seeing the item on the ground.  The player will primarily know an 
item by its short description name.

Don't confuse this with the name field.  Name is used to refer to the object,
short is used to display it.  eg

> get (name)    <-- looks for a match in the name field
You get (short)   <-- displays short to tell player what was gotten

Examples of good short descriptions would be:  a short sword, the painting 
of Batopr or an ivory breastplate.  Just plug in x for "You get x" when 
you make up your shorts. If it makes sense it is probably a decent short 
description.

NOTES:

LOWERCASE LETTERS:  Do not capitalize the words in a short description.
The code knows when to capitalize appropriately.  The only objects that 
are capitalized are artifacts.  One exception to this rule is for proper 
names. also, DON'T put things like periods on the end of the object.

ITEM CONDITION NAMES:  Do not used condition terms in your item names.  
You will get anomalies like "You get a rusty chainmail shirt (brand new)" 
if you do.

                          "A Dragons Tear"

The Tale continues......

   As they feared, when the creator awoke and saw the destruction they 
had wrought he was furious, but was still unable to punish his children.
So all but one he placed in a deep slumber within their lairs.  This 
one had caught his attention though, smaller then his brethren he was a 
young half-breed, a mixture from a steel and a silver dragon.  Constantly 
taunted by the other dragons he often was reclusive and studied tome 
after tome of history or sat for days dreaming.  He sought neither to 
control the humans nor to control anything.  He watched, and he felt 
everything should be in balance.  But what caught the creators eye was 
that he alone shed a single tear over the destruction his brethren had 
caused.  Others laid accusations and blame, but felt no remorse for what
had occurred, but this one dragon watched it all unable to stop it and
felt shame for what his brethren had caused.  This one dragon the creator
spared.

   During his sleep the creator had thought of a way he might watch
over his children as they grew.  By placing his essence within a 
physical object within The World he felt he could continue to watch
over them, but he would still feel the tiredness of his age and would
need someone to watch over his creations as sleep overtook him from 
time to time.  Thus he had selected Toliriss, the one small dragon,
to be his watcher.  Someone who would preserve the balance among his
creations while he slept.

   The creator's first task was to take Toliriss's molted form of 
silver and steel scales and fuse them into a whole.  Thus Toliriss
became the first mithril dragon as the creator immersed his body
in the hottest of all volcanos.  Next the creator imbued Toliriss with
the strength and mystics of an immortal, giving him both his own
skills and magics as well as the powers he captured from the two 
dragons souls whose powers had caused the destruction of the continent.
Now here I must help you understand the nature of an immortal.  While 
we term it an "immortal" there really is no such thing.  Everything has
a lifetime, to us the lifetime of an immortal seems to be endless,
but everything must die.  While the creator had the strength to give 
Toliriss the powers of a true immortal, its was Toliriss' own soul that 
gives him his youth as an immortal.  It is the creators soul which 
fades away, not his powers.  In all of this the creator taxed his 
strength, and with his last bit of consciousness imbued his own soul
into a flawless ball of pure mithril and gave it into the care of 
Toliriss.  Thus the creator would awaken from time to time to look
out over his children, but now it was Toliriss' world to look after
as well.  

   Toliriss overwhelmed with what had occurred wandered for decades
watching over the new world.  He saw its shattered civilizations and 
the birth, and many times destruction, of numerous new civilizations.  
Throughout this time Toliriss observed and learned the balance of
this new world so that he might preserve it.  As time passed he created
the Dragon Citadel where he placed the mystical orb housing the creators
soul and sat back to watch a while longer.  For now the continent of 
Sorrill, which meant in the tongue of the dragon, "The Dragons Tear," 
had been born.


   And here my dear friend must this tale end.

The 'X' and 'Z' commands
Dynamic set creation/loading.

The 'X' command defines a piece of a dynamic (local) eq set.

X <local set number> <slot number> <vnum>

The local set number is 0-15 and is local to your zone.  Sets can be partial
or full, and they can be changed as many times as you wish in your zonefile.
Once a local set has been defined, the 'Z' command is used to load it.  The
'Z' command is identical to the 'Y' command, but operates on local sets only.

Z <if_flag> <set number> <percentage>

<if_flag>       should be 0
<macro-number>  Defines the type of set being loaded (see below)
<percentage>    A percentage chance (recalculated for all slots)

X 10 4 1102              platemail suit
X 10 6 1107              platemail legging
X 10 7 1107              platemail legging
M 0 102 1 104            Elite
Z 0 10 5                 5% chance of our custom 3 piece platemail set

Note 1:
if-flag should be 0.  This is so if equipment loads prior to the Z, the Z
will not be bypassed if equipment prior to it fails to load.  You may still
use an if-flag of 1 if you truly wish the load of the set of armor dependent
on the previous command, although I can't see why you would want to do this.

Note 2:
Z re-rolls the <percentage> for all slots.  It is essentially the
equivalent of doing multiple '?', 'E', '?', 'E', '?', 'E' commands

Note 3:
Z should be the LAST equipment command on a given mob.  Any slot that has
already been equipped prior to the Z command execution will be skipped.
This is so you can put specific single items on the creature and then flesh
out all other slots with stock-equipment.

Note 4:
Be careful when setting load rates for armor. An acceptable load rate on a
Z load should be 5 or less as we do not want players cashing in on load
rates.  Speak with a LOW if you want armor above 5% chance load.

Note 5:
Z loads are still subject to max_exist.  If an item is at or over
max_exist, it will not be loaded by a Z command.

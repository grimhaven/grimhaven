Chapter 14:  Questions, Sign-ups, and Other Information

Sign-ups will be done using the <h> mail system.  If you are new to
<h> and do not know a lot of people but want to participate in team
events please feel free to mail Fay.  He will try to match groups of solos
together.  Make sure you clearly identify the event name and number. 
Address sign-ups to "Fay".  Questions about events or the tournament can
also be addressed to Fay or posted on the tournament/quest board.  This
board is very important to read since it will contain all updated
information.  It may also contain information about additional ways to
sign-up for events.

EXTRA FLAGS

Extra flags determine criteria that the item may have associated with it.
The ANTI-(x) stuff determines who is prevented from wearing the object.
A multi-class can wear an object provided that any one of their classes
is allowed to wear it.  The following are some flags that you will be 
able to set on an object with some explanation.

PAIRED: this causes the item to be worn in both left and right slots.  It is
   only valid for leg (pair of pants) and hold (2 handed sword).  You can't make
   a "pair of shoes", sorry.
GLOW: setting this bit causes the item to produce light.  (in proportion to
   its volume), adds the text "(glowing)" to the name and reduces the canbeseen
   This is the only way to set an object to providing light unless it is 
   explicitly item_type light.
SHADOWY: This is the opposite of Glow
NO_RENT & NO_PURGE: set these flags on all items you are using as furniture
   eq. shrubs, trees, desks, tables, beds, chests, rugs, statues, etc...
   Some items like keys should not be rent-able.
MAGIC: set this if the item has any special magic affects other than AC.
STRUNG: Mostly for internal record keeping.  Similar objects use shared
   memory for text strings.  This bit is set automatically whenever the
   strings are disassociated from heap memory.  It is unlikely that a
   builder will need to change this field ever.
PROTOTYPE: Set on all objects when OEDITed.  Prevents them from falling into
   mortal hands.  57th level gods can remove this bit for quests, etc.
BURNING: A burning item made out of a non-flammable material will not spread
   fire (so make campfires out of rocks, if you are going to be a responsible
   builder!).

Chapter 3:

B.  ARENA BATTLES:  These events will take place either in the Brightmoon
Arena, the Arena area, or in a new Tournament Area built especially for
this tournament.  These events will test your mud characters against other
mud characters.  Battles will be one and one and group against group and
will be set out by level so that you do not fight anyone too different in
level than you.  Battles will all be held in arena areas so experience
will not be lost.  Looting will not be allowed. In addition to planned
tournament jousts, specific grudge challenges will be held between any
characters wishing to fight each other for their greater glories.  People
wishing to fight or issue a challenge should post them on the tournament
board.  Those not meeting a challenge will be considered cowards.  Among
the specific events planned include: 

	One on One Arena Challenges:    Based on level.

	Group Challenges:		Based on total levels in group.	

	Mage Spellcasting Challenges:	Mages against others.

	Capture the Flag:		See event book for details

	Grudge Challenges:		Post challenges on Tournament
						Board.

         <d>The Second Book of Ethren<1>

<y>Chapter 1<1>
             
<y>1.<1>Now this was the intent of the Cult for they had placed spies
amongst the inhabitants even so much
that they infested the Judgment Seat itself.
<y>2.<1>And now it came to pass that those debase fiends
did plant in the minds of the citizens of Grimoire Haven
that I, the Prophet and Guardian of the Order
had exercised my wrath over mine own brethren,
yea, and wove so many more lies amongst them
that they may bring about contention
and stir up the hearts of men against our brotherhood
and also against myself.
<y>3.<1>Yea and they did go on to say,

<d>"How is it so that this Ethren the supposed seer<1>
<d>hast known of this murder before we?<1>
<y>4.<1><d>Behold, we know that this Ethren must have agreed<1>
<d>with his own guardsmen to put these our citizens to the sword,<1>
<d>and he hath done so that he might declare it unto us,<1>
<d>that he might convert us unto his faith,<1>
<d>that he might raise himself up to be a great man,<1>
<d>chosen of the deities, and a Prophet.<1>
<y>5.<1><d>And behold will we not detect this man?<1>
<d>Yea, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us<1>
<d>the true murderer of these two men."<1>

<y>Chapter 2<1>

<y>1.<1>Yea and they caused that I should be taken,
and I suffered it to be so...and they did bind my wrists.
<y>2.<1>Then they began to question me in divers way that they may cross me,
that they might accuse me to death saying,

<y>3.<1><d>"Thou are a man of the Knighthood,<1>
<d>who has done this murder?  <1>
Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault;"<1>

saying, 

<y>4.<1><d>"Behold here is money; and also we will grant thee thy life<1>
<d>if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement<1>
<d>which thou hast made with him."<1>

<y>5.<1>Verily I said unto them,

<d>"O ye fools, ye weak of heart, ye blind<1>
<d>and ye stiffnecked people,<1>
<d>do you know how long the hand of Galek<1>
<d>shall suffer you that ye should go on<1>
<d>in this way of immorality and deceit?<1>
<y>6.<1><d>O ye ought to howl and mourn<1>
<d>because of the great destruction that doth await you<1>
<d>if ye do not repent!<1>
<y>7.<1><d>Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man<1>
<d>that he should murder our own missionaries.<1>
<d>But behold, I say unto you,<1>
<d>that this is because I have testified unto you<1>
<d>that ye might know concerning this thing;<1>
<d>yea, even for a witness unto you,<1>
<d>that I did know of the abominations among you.<1>
<y>8.<1><d>And because I have done this,<1>
<d>ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing;<1>
<d>yea, because I showed unto you this ye are angry with me<1>
<d>and seek to take away my life.<1>
<y>9.<1><d>And now behold, I will show unto you another sign<1>
<d>and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.<1>

<y>10.<1> <d>Behold go unto the house of Darak Z'Tharnin<1>
<d>and say unto him, Has Ethren the pretended prophet<1>
<d>who doth prophesy so much decadence amongst this people,<1>
<d>agreed with thee in the which ye have murdered<1>
<d>those missionaries who are of our own city?<1>
<y>11.<1> <d>And behold he shall say unto you, Nay.<1>
<y>12.<1> <d>And then ye shall say unto him,<1>
<d>Have ye murdered those missionaries of Galek?<1>
<y>13.<1> <d>And he shall stand with fear and wouldst not what to say.<1>
<d>And behold, he shall deny unto you;<1>
<d>and shall make as though he were astonished;<1>
<d>nevertheless, he shall declare unto that he is innocent.<1>
<y>14.<1> <d>but behold ye shall examine him,<1>
<d>and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak.<1>
<d>And when ye shall see this, ye shall say:<1>
<y>15.<1> <d>From whence cometh this blood?<1>
<d>Do we not know that this is the blood of those missionaries?<1>
<y>16.<1> <d>Then shall he tremble and look pale,<1>
<d>even as death had come upon him.<1>
<y>17.<1> <d>And then ye shall say:<1>
<d>Because of this fear which has come upon your face,<1>
<d>behold we know that thou art guilty.<1>
<y>18.<1> <d>And then shall greater fear come upon him;<1>
<d>and then shall he confess unto you,<1>
<d>and deny no more that he has done this murder.<1>
<d>And then shall he say unto you, that I Ethren,<1>
<d>know nothing concerning this matter<1>
<d>save it were given me by the power of Deity.<1>
<y>19.<1> <d>And then ye shall know that I am an honest man<1>
<d>and am sent to you by the hand of Galek the Wise."<1>

<y>Chapter 3<1>

<y>1.<1>And it came to pass that they went
and did according as I had said.
<y>2.<1>And behold the words which I had said they found to be true,
according to the words which he denied,
as well as those he confessed.
<y>3.<1>Insomuch as my Guards and myself were set at liberty
and Darak was taken captive.
<y>4.<1>Now there were some who believed in my words as a Prophet,
and others who thought I was a Deity,
for in their minds except I was I could not know all this.
<y>5.<1>And it came to pass that there arose a great division among the people
that they divided hither and thither
and went there way leaving us alone.

<y>Chapter 4<1>

<y>1.<1>Now I was prompted I must strike down
the cause of this murder at the very center.
<y>2.<1>Without delay we rushed to make preparations for a counter strike
for I was in mine anger.
<y>3.<1>Yea and I did ponder much what I should do
within the halls of our cathedral whilst around me clanged
the preparations of war.
<y>4.<1>When before me appeared a personage of Glory and brightness.  

<y>5.<1><d>"Greetings Ethren, blessed art thou<1>
<d>for those things which thou hast done.<1>
<y>6.<1><d>I have beheld how thou hast declared the word<1>
<d>with unwearingness of heart and a purity of mind.<1>
<y>7.<1><d>Thou hast not feared thine oppressors,<1>
<d>in spite of them seeking to take away your life,<1>
<d>but hast sought only to do my will.<1>
<y>8.<1><d>Now because thou hast done this I will make thee mighty<1>
<d>in word and in deed.<1>
<y>9.<1><d>Even that ye may smite upon that foul one that ruineth The World<1>
<d>with his treachery."<1>

<y>10.<1> And with that he stretched forth his finger and touched my blade.
And it did course with power.

<y>Chapter 5<1>

<y>1.<1>The battle raged tremendous.
<y>2.<1>Our allegiances the Bullywugs, and forest rangers evaporated
amidst the treachery and vast bribes funded from slavery and oppression
at the hands of Logrus's Vampyr and his minions.
<y>3.<1>Hoards of orcs flanked our boundaries,
but were of little consequence before the Elite Paladin Guard.
<y>4.<1>However, our routes of retreat collapsed as their numerous hosts
descended with carnal fury upon my valiant army of Knights.
<y>5.<1>Many had fallen, yet we had reached the gates of Logrus
with a ferocity and vindication for our fallen brothers.
<y>6.<1>It seemed as though we had finally gained a hold
upon the walls of the mighty fortress walls surrounding Logrus,
when a cries of pain penetrated the my ranks
as a suffocating darkness engulfed our bodies.
<y>7.<1>No doubt this was the work of their perverse Deities.
My men crippled in pain. 
<y>8.<1>I felt mine own frame sustained only through the faith within.
<y>9.<1>With a loud voice I cried unto them,

<d>"Ye shall not be slain by your enemies!<1>
<y>10.<1> <d>For it has been spoken,<1>
<d>"Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed!"<1>
<d>We must prevent the subjugation of our lands,<1>
<d>our people, our liberty and our Faith!<1>
<d>Victory for them and for Galek!"<1>

<y>Chapter 6<1>

<y>1.<1>We did fight as with the strength of dragons!
Yea and we did press forward through the darkness
into the very heart of the city.
<y>2.<1>There my greatest horror awaited.
His fiendish grin inspired a fear that was unhuman.
I was frozen and heard amidst the cries of my dying brethren
only my heart pound.

<y>3.<1><d>"Chortling, he bent towards my leader.<1>
<d>I saw only his armored frame, motionless. <1>
<d>I wanted to cry out for help, but I could not, <1>
<d>I was held powerless by the power of the dark creature. <1>
<y>4. <1><d>His hand came up to that of Ethren, <1>
<d>touching his cheek softly...with a cruel tenderness. <1>
<y>5. <1><d>Tears rolled down my eyes as the great frame of Ethren <1>
<d>shriveled beneath the touch of this...this... Prince of Death. <1>
<y>6. <1><d>Almost unconscious and without hope <1>
<d>my eyes witnessed something incredible. <1>
<d>The Sword of Galek still coursed with an incredible power. <1>
<y>7. <1><d>Drawing deep within his final reserves of faith and hope, <1>
<d>M'lord lifted the pulsating Devastator enough to destroy the daemon. <1>
<d>Reeling in pain the Vampyr cried out mightily <1>
<d>shredding the sounds of war with his wail. <1>
<y>8. <1><d>White magik purified the vulgar body as a poison. <1>
<d>Its hands clenched in agony. <1>
<y>9. <1><d>Shrieking he dropped the withered body of Ethren to the ground, <1>
<d>through himself upon his steed <1>
<d>which charged at his will eastward to the abyss <1>
<d>we know now as the Temple of the Undead."<1>

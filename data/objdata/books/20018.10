mud.  The first player starts with a baton, races along until he finds his
2nd man, hands the baton to his teammate, and the 2nd man races along to
find the third... etc.  The third player must finish the race with the
baton *IN HIS HAND* or he is disqualified.  Contestants are to meet at
the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the area above Grimhaven Center Square

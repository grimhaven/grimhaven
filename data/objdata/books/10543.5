Section 5:
		
Long Missing Explorer Found

For several months, the city of Grimhaven has been conduction a realm-wide 
search for a party of missing explorers sent out to re-map the surrounding
realms.  Last night on the rising of the full moon a bleeding, disfigured
man staggered through the north gate of Grimhaven.  He was immediately
taken to the hospital for medical attention.  Though the doctors were
unable to save him, much was learned of what befell the party of explorers.
In painful spurts, the explorer  told of an outpost of fire that claimed
the lives of half the exploring party.  He also was recorded ranting about
a small town besieged with undead that eventually claimed all but three of
the explorers.  It was upon relating his last exploration that he seem to
go into a seizure.  Muttering about large worms and dark chambers, he
suddenly began screaming at the top of his lungs "Atakaji… Atakaji…"  The 
explorer known as Renwar Pathfinder passed away this morning, a testament
to the increased dangers of the outside world.

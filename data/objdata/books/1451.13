Max structure

The maximum structure the item can have.  Structure corresponds to the 
strength of the item and how much damage it can take.  Damage and repair 
are some of the primary economic regulators of the mud so structure 
numbers should be looked at carefully.  

One of the most common errors is to equate AC and high structure. 
Although there will in general be a reasonable convergence, the two should
not be thought of as identical.  Items can give good protection but damage
easily. 

The affect of this error in thinking is that there is a tendency to have 
high structures on robes and other non-tank items worn by casters.  Mana 
items must have considerably lower structure than tanking gear.  We do 
not want casters walking around in high AC, high mana, high structure items.
You must put in trade-offs between these three object features. 

You can use super low structure to make fragile items with decent affects 
that will circulate more than other items.  However, be aware that 
players tend to keep such items in bags and not wear them so do not think 
of a super low structure as a trade off for a big item affect.

NOTES:

CHECK YOUR FIGURES AGAINST ITEMS IN THE WORLD:  Pretty self explanatory.

ROBES AND OTHER MANA ITEMS:  Remember to set mana objects to lower 
structure than tanking items.  Keep structures reasonable.

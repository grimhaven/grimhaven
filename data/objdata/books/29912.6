Chapter VI: Final Words of Wisdom.

	To you my reader, these are my final words. I, Ashe Deathbane
Overlord of the Serpent, relate to you, my reader, a very old story. Once,
there was an orphan born in the slums of the back alley of the great city
of Grimhaven. For ten years, this little kid watched the gangsters of the
slums steal,kill,rape and loot. For ten years, this kid was living in
fear, doing whatever was commanded to be done by the older bullies of the
alley. One winder past his first ten, this boy was starving and hungry in
the harsh icy streets of the city. He tried to steal some cheese from a
passerby and got caught and ended up thrown in the cold gutters.
	This frail child should have died, but Luna's smile was upon him.
A thief in jail saw him and took him for an apprentice. When he got bailed out,
by the thief guild in Grimhaven, he was taken and taught the basics of
thievery. But his eyes lingered beyond the walls of the city.
	On his 18th summer, the orphan left the city and ran away from
his guild. He vowed never ever to be frail. He vowed to be better than all
those who laughed at his weak body. He would practice and practice till he
became the best.
	Twenty two summers later, a strange man walks the streets of the
slums of Grimhaven. Two thugs were beating a thin 14 year old boy. In a
blink of an eye, two bodies ended up in the shadows. That morning, the
gate guards saw a forty year old man riding with a fourteen years old
boy. That boy is known as Brat. Ponder upon these words my reader, for one
day when you feel supreme, you will look around for a face that smiles
back to you genuinely. And always remember to survive is not to play by
the rules, it is to make the rules.

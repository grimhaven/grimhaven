General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE SOLUTION OF SHERCADIA

The results of the first Faeriekin conference at Shercadia were profound.
Beset by a potential enemy that would consume them all, the Four Races hit upon
a plan not to fight the humans, but instead to alter the situation sufficiently
that the problem could be managed or at least contained.

The initial proposal made by Gunderi, chief council for the gnomes, was to
subvert the very structure of the human's being.  Gunderi revealed that the
gnome studies had found that the human makeup could be manipulated by them, 
although he was careful to avoid bringing up the issue of how gnomes had
developed this gnowledge nor what else gnomes gnew about human kind.  With that
formality out of the way he proposed that humans be subverted, altering their
genetic makeup so as to make them less dangerous.

The final proposal was to graft together the best quality of each race into a
human test bed in the hopes that the final product would not only be superior to
the existing humans, thus supplanting them, but also more similar to Four Races
that they might be able to reap the benefits of such a cross matching, for
each race coveted humans for their adaptability.

Chapter 3:  Challenge Events Generally.

All the events described in this book will take place in arenas around the
known world and in a tournament zone built just for this tournament. 
These events will test a combination of your skills, your knowledge of the
mud, and the strength and equipment of your character.

Description and Rules:  In each challenge event, each player is allowed to
use one and only *one* character.  In group events, players will be given
a color that represents his group.  Players may *not* switch from their
designated groups at any time unless approval is given from the god
running the event. Players will assemble at the Challenge Events 
Contestant's Lounge in the Tournament Area above Grimhaven Center Square
or in an area designated by a tournament organizer prior to the event.  To
get to the lounge go up from Center Square and follow the signs. 

Last minute instructions and details will be covered, and quick questions
and comments will be addressed.  Everyone is expected to have read the
tournament board and acquired all information regarding their chosen event
prior to gametime.  Depending upon the event, the players will either go
solo or be divided into groups of their choosing or groups chosen by a
god.

If applicable a player's solo or group quest flags will be set and they
will be unable to receive help from any outside source until the event is
finished.  Reasons for the flags being set in an event is so players are
unable to group with an outside source and impede outside assistance.  In
any event, all activities are monitored by one or more gods so it will be
quite easy to spot unfair play. 

Any players caught cheating in any way will be immediately disqualified
from all events, have all prizes won revoked, and may be subject to
reduction in level.  This also applies to looting and thievery which will
be punished severely.  Detailed in the other chapters are descriptions and
details of the various challenge events.

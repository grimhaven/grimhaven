A response file consists of a header, comments, and multiple response
blocks.  The header consist of 4 lines, each starting with a #.  The first
line is the mob's name associated with the file, the second is the quest
name, the third is the creator and the fourth is copyright information.
Comments give more information about a file and also start with a #.  Each
response block indicates all actions to be associated with a given
trigger.

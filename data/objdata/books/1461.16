Trigger: package
---------------------
 
ex:
package { "<number>";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

<trigger> { "";
	link package <number>;
	}

The package trigger was designed to handle places where duplicate functionality
was required.  That is, if I want a number of responses all to do the same
thing, rather than create highly redundant functionality in many responses,
I can create a single "package" with the actions that will be repeated, and
link to this package via the "link" action.

There is no direct way to call a package.  The only way a package is
accessible is via a "link" to it.  You can link to a package any number
of times.

The <number> argument is used to uniquely identify any number of packages on
the same mob.  Thus, you can have "package 1" and "package 2" that are
separate responses called from separate locations.  Obviously, indeterminate
results would occur if you had two "package 1"s on the same creature.

Packages are unique to each mob.  There is no way to call a package on a
different mob.

Planning: Theme and contents

The most important thing to remember when picking a theme for your area is
to not be overly ambitious. We all have a tendency to start zones with grand
ideas, but keep it simple. You have probably been given a 25 room zone and
there's only so much you can do with that.

You should have a general idea of where your zone will be in the world so it
fits in thematically. Try to make a one line concept of your zone, something
like:
	"A sunken pirate ship full of undead pirates."
	"A small rancher town, with a saloon."
	"A forest with fruit bearing trees."

Now you can start thinking what will be in the zone. Detail the zone some more:
main areas, mobs and equipment that it'll have.

For the forest example:
	Area for fruit storage.
	Living quarters for the workers.
	It'd be fun if the workers were golems!
	There should be an office in a hollow tree.
	Need some mobs to be guards.

At this point you should present your ideas to the LOW for approval. There will
probably be some brainstorming about it, questions etc. It now starts to get fun!

Wrapping up: Zonefile

Like the response file, the zonefile is a plain text file with
directives. It tells the mud what to do with your zone: where to
place mobiles, how to handle doors and equipment etc.

The mud has a feature that does some of the blunt work for you.
It's, apropriately, the ZONEFILE command. But before you use it,
you have to set up your zone.

RLOAD your one, walk through it and place all the mobiles, their
equipment and furniture. Your zone should look just like it would
in the mud, but with mobs wearing all their equipment and inventory.
To equip a mob use OUTFIT <item> <mob>. To place things in the
inventory, just GIVE <item> <mob>. LOOK at the mob to make sure it's
wearing everything properly etc.

When everything is in place, type ZONEFILE SAVE. It'll generate a
basic zonefile that you can view with VIEWOUTPUT. Copy and paste this
to a file in your machine because you'll have to tweak it some.

Now, pick up your copy of the ZONEFILE BOOK and adjust the file the
mud created for you. Also, remember to read HELP ZONEFILE for there
are things the mud won't do for you so you have to adjust it yourself.

When you are done, send the zonefile to the LOW and ask for a beta
test. Provided everything is ok, your zone should be in in no time!
It wasn't so hard, was it? :)

Now, enjoy your promotion and starting thinking of a new zone idea.
And keep them coming!

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF INTERFERENCE

Of the Faerie groups that had participated in the great debate, none were
stronger than those led on one side by Logrus and on the other by Galek.  Two
of the most powerful Faeries, they could not agree on what form the
interference should be to solve the Elf question.

Logrus on one side advocated the older policies of making The World
inhospitable.  At some point when things looked bleakest, he would then
offer them a way back to the paradise of home.  His plan required the least
effort, for the five civilized races had done an exceptional job of creating
chaos.

On the other side was Galek.  His biggest problem with Logrus's ideas was in
the unnecessary bloodshed that would be required.  He instead supported
restoring knowledge of what Faerie life was like in the hopes that that alone
would be enough for them to want to return.

Logrus wished to create havoc until there was no choice but to return.
Galek maintained that the return was by no means a sure thing.  As Faerie
Magik's strength was tied to the condition of The World, Galek reasoned it
best to heal the planet rather then bring harm to it.

In the end, neither Galek nor Logrus won.  For it was decided by the body
of Faeries that neither course was guaranteed success, and they opted to
give both methods a chance, to see which would bring about a greater
result.  And so, Galek and Logrus became the first Faeries to enter The
World since the release of the Dwarves.

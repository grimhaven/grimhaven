SOLO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGE RACE:  A race in which a player attempts to
accumulate as many experience points as possible on his or her own in the
given time limit.  Players will choose their competing characters from any
of their existing PC's.  All competitors will meet at the Mud-Wide
Contestant's Lounge in the area above Grimhaven Center Square unless
another place is designated on the Tournament Board or by mail. 
Competitors will have their experience recorded and then have their Quest
Flags set.  They will then have 1 hour to gain as much experience as they
can.  There is no restriction on where players may go to earn this xp, but
the same rules against cheating on <h> apply to this race.  (no free
xp policy :) At the end of the hour, the tournament organizer will record
your experience and compare you to other competitors in your level range. 
In signing up, you just sign your character up. You will be placed in your
appropriate level range by your level at the time of the tournament.  See
charts for tentative level breakdowns.

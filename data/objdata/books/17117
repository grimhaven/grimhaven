Birth of the Overlords....

   Centuries ago, In the year of L'yrel a small village of natives
lived upon the outskirts of a mountain side.  The community was
somewhat isolated from the mainstream of life and lay some sixty
miles from the nearest town; even the fastest horse could not reach
it in three days. Tucked away thus, the village consisted of less then
a hundred houses, scattered in six criss-crossed streets. The rice fields
stretched westwards that merged into the wooded slopes of the mountains.

  Trade had come early to the village and water was obtained from a
well open to the skies at the villages center.  It's been recorded that
one day a tribesman, while out about in the fields of rice stumbled upon
an ancient oracle set within an enchanted circle of stones. Being the
curious native, he ventured into it and transformed into the first Dark
Overlord, an evil reckless of destruction.

  From the mountains the overlord came, slowly descending at first,
then with an eerie war cry it burst into a speeding bolt towards the
village killing every man woman and child in sight.  After the desolation
of the village, the overlord set his foot upon the earth once more before
the oracle, placing the dead mangled bodies of the villagers within the
circle.

Four values

These are 4 separate integer values.  What the 4-values correspond to depends
on the items type.  For instance, a weapon references sharpness, damage and
weapon type; whereas bags need to know how much volume and weight can be put
into it.

The OEDIT editor will tell you what the 4 values reference.

Please use some caution when setting 4-value figures.  The code can become
confused by bogus values and it may cause a crash.


NOTES:

CHECK CAREFULLY: Make sure the items that require value setting have 
their values set after you make them.

ZERO VALUES IF YOU CHANGE ITEM TYPE OF AN OBJECT

Chapter 3:  Mud-Wide Events

All the events described in this book will take place in the known world
and will test a combination of your skills and your knowledge of the mud. 
The particulars of each event vary and ranges from experience challenge
races to Grimhaven Hide and Seek. 

Description and Rules:  In each event, each player is allowed to use one
and only *one* character.  In group events, players will be given a color
that represents his group.  Players may *not* switch from their designated
groups at any time unless approval is given from the god running the
event. Players will assemble at the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the
Tournament Area above Grimhaven Center Square or in an area designated by
a tournament organizer prior to the event.  To get to the lounge go up
from Center Square and follow the signs.  

Last minute instructions and details will be covered, and quick questions
and comments will be addressed.  Everyone is expected to have read the
tournament board and acquired all information regarding their chosen event
prior to gametime.  Depending upon the event, the players will either be
divided into groups of their choosing or groups chosen by a god.  There
will be solo events as well.  

The player's solo or group quest flags will be set and they will be unable
to receive help from any outside source until the event is finished. 
Reasons for the flags being set on a race is so players are unable to
group with an outside source and be dragged around the mud by someone who
knows the place better than they.  In any event, all activities are
monitored by one or more gods so it will be quite easy to spot unfair
play.  

Any players caught cheating in any way will be immediately disqualified
from all events, have all prizes won revoked, and may be subject to
reduction in level.  Detailed in the other chapters are descriptions and
details of the various races and events.

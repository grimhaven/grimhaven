Day 30
Well, the ogre's helped me make a little hut in a tree.
Seems I've got me a new home. It's nice to be up above
those damn bugs!

No idea what day it is...
My home is great. Ogre is still around, and he's keeping
me ... good company. Never mind. I just need to vent in
writing ... my janky Momma's in the swamp! I'd kill her if 
she wasn't family. I hid the entrance. Maybe she'll give
up. As long as the still keeps working, I'll survive.
Damn, why won't she JUST GIVE UP!

Advanced Action: resize
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       resize <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

Resize is an action that will load the item given by <number> as a vnum,
resize it to fit the person who did the trigger's items, personalize
the item, and then give it to the person.

At the end of the resize action, the item will be in the performer's
inventory, so you do NOT need to do a separate give.  Resize also loads
so do NOT do a separate load.

There is text associated with resizing automatically done.  You do not
need separate echos for loading, stringing and giving.

Note - this action should be used VERY sparingly, and only with the
express permission of the LOW.  We have sized objects and set race heights
the way they are for a reason and too much resizing will unbalance things.

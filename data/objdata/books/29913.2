The Way of Logrus

       Logrus was the Enlightened One, a philosopher mage who brought
the Truth to The World. Logrus preached that all events in the history
of The World have been shaped by Superior men and women- those whose
virtues have set them apart from the common, mundane, weak masses.
Logrus said that these Superior men and women were not necessarily
Superior from birth; they were not Superior from noble blood in
their veins, or wealth, or from the opportunities that an education
afforded them- rather, they had made themselves Superior by an act of
Will. All beings had within them strength, and the potential for
strength, but not all beings would become Superior, for not all would
have the will necessary to improve themselves. By placing superior
men and women in positions in which they would have power, or affording
them the opportunities so that they might seize power, they could
effect changes to The World, to the benefit of all. To recognize those
who would take advantage of their natural strengths, Logrus created a
system that would continually test all within the Cult, measuring their
talents, and most importantly, their ability to improve those talents.
       Logrus has taught us to show contempt for our inferiors-
inferiors being those not in the Cult through ignorance or weakness,
or those who have not yet improved themselves despite their potential to
do so. It was hoped that this continual abuse might provide the
encouragement necessary for Inferiors to improve themselves. Even if
inferiors did not prove themselves capable of becoming Superior leaders,
they would at least become better servants. If a man was judged
incapable of improving himself, he was to be pitied, not held in
contempt, and his station in society would thereafter become immutable-
while he could not rise above his station, having proven that he is not
possessed of the potential to do so, he could not sink below his current
status, as he certainly could not be weaker than he has been already
observed.
       Logrus also showed us the importance of indulging our Superiors.
Should abuse of, and contempt for inferiors not prove sufficient
inducement for their advancement, the lavishing of a luxurious lifestyle
upon those who rule may. It has been the right, and even the obligation
of the Grand master, Logrus Master, and ruling Superiors to indulge their
pleasures in whatever manner suits them. This break from the early
asceticism of the Cult occurred in the year 518, when this new
interpretation of the Way was written by Logrus Master Jolusguld II.

ATTRIBUTES TYPES AND THE NEW STAT SYSTEM

Stats are divided into Physical, Mental and Utility attributes.  There are
more of them and the scale is much broader than past versions of <h>,
growing by nearly a factor of 10.  This is a new system and will be unfamiliar.
We implemented in this manner so as to obtain more diversity in stats and to
make <h> more racial and skill based.  We also were highly motivated by
past balance meetings in which mortals asked us to 1) make stat more diverse
and 2) decrease the emphasis on warriors maxing their physical stats and
casters only maxing their mental stats.  We had no actual diversity on 4.1
even though theoretically it was possible.  The primary goal of our stat
system design was to try to make tradeoff between stats between equal value
stats.  Thus not every player would rob karma for strength or intelligence
depending on their class.

This area has been the most frequently asked question of the beta.  Why
can't you trade between categories.  Understand that our decision was
conscious and a decision not to allow it rather than something we didn't
think about.  We consciously do not allow tradeoffs between categories
because trade-offs between unequal stats was one of the major problems in
obtaining diversity on 4.1 and earlier versions.  Every warrior was stupid
and maxed their available strength, dex and con.  Every mage was smart and
weak.  The only place where there were differences was between 18 and 19
in a stat and a 12 was meaningless.  We are trying to eliminate that
problem in this new system. We may or may not allow bonus stats during
creation but will be unlikely to allow looting between categories of
unequal stats. Note that strength for a mage may not help him that much
but his trade off will be only against dex or con and be offset by race as
well.  It will not be trading a meaningful stat versus a non-meaningful
one.  If you want a certain type of character, look at the races first
before selecting your trade-offs.

One last note.  Physical stats are more important for warriors still but
we have adjusted at the code level (or will if bugged) for the fact that
warriors will not be maxed physically.  Mental stats do seem to affect
all PC's. Intelligence sets practices, Wisdom learning rates and focus how
well you perform a skill.  They are hopefully equal in importance and an
intelligent race warrior may have some advantages that offset his
detriments from his physical characteristics versus an ogre. That
intelligence may come from his race or from his tradeoffs within the race.

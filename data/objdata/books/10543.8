Section 8:

City of Logrus Builds Headquarters for Cult

  The City of Logrus has announced the recent construction of the faction 
headquarters for the Cult of Logrus.  It is reported that many aspiring
Cult members have begun to gather there to discuss faction matters and plan
for the future.  Some initiates can be seen training there night and day.
The Cult Faction Headquarters has also become a military strong-point for
the city and has helped turn aside recent incursions into the city,
including drow raiders and an evil army of undead sent by the banished
Bishop Seklor.  The Logrus Master has commended the architects of the
Headquarters and was heard on the record saying, "You builders have given a
great gift to the City of Logrus.  This great building will not only serve
as a gathering spot for Cultists everywhere, but is a great symbol of the
glory of Logrus.  People will once more know what it means to be a Logrite!"  
  Though the building of the Faction Headquarters has received a positive 
response in the Logrus areas, it has also prompted the other factions to
begin plans of their own for similar headquarters.  The Overlord of Amber
was on hand to comment, "Though we hope to avoid any conflicts with the
Logrites at present, it only makes sense that we build our own headquarters
to help improve trade."  The representatives of Brightmoon were apparently
a little less neutral in their response.  Augustine the Proctor announced
at a local conference, "We see the building of a Cult Headquarters as a
possible first step to increasing their dominating hold on the surrounding
areas.  We plan on building our own to help educate and free the minds of
the populace."  Whether or not this new fervor toward the major factions of
the realm will be positive or negative, remains to be seen.

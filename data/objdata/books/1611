General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE SECOND AGE OF THE WORLD

While indeed there was tremendous potential for great advancement with the
Faeries having left the scene, however temporarily, it was not realized chiefly
because of the state of affairs The World had been left in by the Faeries.

The Elves still followed the leadership of the Council of High Ones, but they
too were in a state of confusion.  The oldest Elves and all of the High Ones
that were left still advocated remaining faithful to the original ideas
and coexisting with the nature around them, yet the younger generations began
to turn away from this pacifism as the toll of the dwarven raids continued to
mount.  More and more, the younger Elves looked to the Drow for guidance.

At the same time, dwarven society, never strong on brain power to begin with,
had centered on purging the faerie kin from The World.  Mastering the art of
metallurgy and weapon making had been but one step, learning to approach without
detection via tunneling had been another.  Yet their chief problem was also a
lack of leadership, for no dwarf had yet distinguished himself as undisputed
leader.

The gnomes for their part, continued to remain aloof, although this was soon to
change.  Having developed a communal consciousness, leadership was a shared task
and hence not a problem.  They had turned their attention to exploring their own
powers of magik.

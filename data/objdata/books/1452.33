a warrior-class mob.

step 1: pick the approximate level the mob should be
step 2: set the mob's class to warrior and the mobs level
step 3: set the AC as 60 - 2* level
step 4: set the barehand dam and num of attacks so that the average dam
        per round is    level/1.1
step 5: give it 11 * level hp as a bonus
  or
step 5: give it a sanct and 3.25 * level hp as a bonus

You can get a feel for the level your mob is by using the following formula:
if exp is less then 8000, its level should be:
    level = square_root (xp/20)
else
    level = cube_root (xp)

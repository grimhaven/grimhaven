Galek Brightmoon, Maker of Fools

       We have been the eternal adversaries of the Brotherhood of Galek
Brightmoon. The history of this conflict dates back for as long as the
Cult has existed, since the Enlightened One himself walked The World.
Although our opposition to these fools has not always been bloody,
sometimes taking the more mild form of intellectual debate, it has
remained a constant source of concern for all Grand masters since Logrus
himself. The foolish ideology of the Brotherhood is completely
incompatible with the Truth of the Way of Logrus. Their insistence on
the pursuit of such vague, romanticized ideals as 'Truth, Justice, and
Beauty' is an example of a decadent society, which coddles the weak. By
emphasizing the highly over-valued virtue of personal liberty, they place
feeble leaders upon thrones, thus preventing the strong from ever
benefiting all through their abilities. Their accusation of tyranny
simply shows their incredible naivete - the strong must act without the
unnecessary weaknesses of self-denial, limitations upon the abilities of
the strong. It is through their glorification of ideals which they deny
the harshness of reality - a harshness which we seek to overcome, while
they merely ignore. Even when they do not actively oppose us, they act
as incredible impediments to true progress, and must be dealt with
swiftly, harshly, and permanently.

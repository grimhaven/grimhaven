Races of <h>
------------------

Be sure to understand the races before making a selection in stone. 
<h>, at this stage, is very hard on non-human races.  By 
understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the races, you should
get a better idea of what you would like to play.

You should definitely read HELP RACE.
See the HELP files for each race: human, ogre, gnome, hobbit, elf, dwarf
before selecting your permanent character.

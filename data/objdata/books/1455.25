Some PC just robbed/killed me.  What can I do?
----------------------------------------------
(player killing, and player looting)

<h> has tried various methods of dealing with these two problems in
the past.  The current rules can be found in the newbie guide.

We encourage players to handle their own affairs without the intervention
of a god.  The exception to this rule is where a newbie (level 1-5) is
concerned.  Newbies are HANDS OFF without the explicit ok of a god to
deal with them.  This is so characters who are learning the rules are
not turned off by some quick-to-retaliate player.  In the case where a
newbie is on just causing havoc, gods will generally authorize their killing
BUT you do need to get that authorization or face penalty.

If the players are both over level 5, gods won't interfere except in extreme
cases.

Flags

Room flags denote characteristics the room has.  They are mostly used
internally by the code.  Do not think you have to make extensive use of
these flags to build a good zone.  They should be used sparingly and in
context.  In addition, some of the flags should not be used in your zone
at all (private) and some only in conjunction with others
(i.e..peaceful/noheal).

Building: Room Description

The room description should describe the room as you see it when you're
standing in it. Look up, down, what do you see?  Mention windows and doors
but do not mention non-permanent objects and creatures. Avoid the use of the
word "you". Be careful when describing an exit, don't assume people have
entered from a specific direction. Make sure there are clues for secret exits.
Use double spaces before each new sentence.

You now have three options for entering room description: 
	a. You can use the CGI room editor at
http://www.sneezymud.com/cgi-bin/roomeditor.cgi (not IE compatible);
	b. Use the REDIT editor;
	c. use the EDIT editor command line.

The CGI editor is pretty self explanatory. You'll see a list of rooms, just
click on one of them and start writing down on the appropriate field.

The REDIT command is also very intuitive. Just type REDIT while standing in
the room, type 2 for room description menu and enter the text.

To use the EDIT editor, while in the room type EDIT DESCRIPTION, hit enter
and start typing. When you're done typing, enter "~". That's it!

Again, don't forget to RSAVE constantly!

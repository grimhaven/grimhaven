Name

The name field is used mostly internally.  When the character types something
like, get (x), look at (x), wear (x) it searches the objects in the room
or inventory for a match of (x) and a word in the name field.

Thus, the name field is used to REFERENCE the object.  Do not confuse this
with the short_description though (see below).  They will be similar but 
not identical in most cases.

It is important to set the space separated list of names up in the correct 
order.  The FIRST word in the name field is used by the code in some
combat situations.  For instance, the item-damage code shows the first word
as follows:

Your (first-name of x) is damaged by Batopr's hit.

so...
You want to MAKE SURE that the first word is the most generic definition of
the object.  eg.  a huge long sword would have a name field of: sword huge long
eg. a platemail helmet would be: helmet platemail mail

NOTES:

NAMES AND ITEM CONDITION:  Do not use conditions in your item names..like 
"tattered robe" or "rusted shirt".  We have item condition so this will 
show as tattered robe (excellent) or rusted shirt (brand new).  Let item 
condition speak for itself.

UNIQUE NAMES:  It is *very* important that your item have the first 2 
words unique cause of some of the quirks of the shop code.  Shops can not 
distinguish between chainmail shirt and chainmail shirt hobbit.  The 
solution is to name it chainmail hobbit shirt.

REDUNDANT NAMES:  The code allows abbreviations, hence we don't need both 
"plate" and "platemail", but we do need "platemail" and "mail".

CAPITALIZATION AND TRIVIAL WORDS:  The name field should not be
capitalized.  Nor should there be trivial words like "of" "the" "a" "an"
etc in it.

REFERENCIAL WORDS:  Sometimes you'll want to add words to an object's name that
are just for reference. Enclose these words in brackets [ ]. Examples: the
race/class an aquipment is made for or room number a key is for. "mask cloth
black ball [human_thief]" or "key sitting room [apartment_above_felicia]".
This is helpful for finding stuff while preventing the name to overlap with 
something else.

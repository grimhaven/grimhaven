Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your running 
skills.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant character to
participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you will meet
with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details and
assign you this color and this contestant character.  The tournament 
organizer will then direct you to the starting line.

This event is just an old fashioned sprint but don't expect it to be in a
straight line.  You will run 13 rooms, pick up a flag, run the 12 rooms
back to the tournament organizer and hand him the flag.  You will then
repeat the process on a second track.  Do not be alarmed if you see or 
pass another contesting going back the other way.  

The sprint will be over when you have handed both flags to the tournament
organizer who will have timed you.  The winner will be the contestant 
with the fastest time.

This event will be run in heats.  You will be grouped randomly in groups 
of four (4).  The winners of these groups will then compete against each 
other to determine the event winner and runner-up.

May the fastest runner win.

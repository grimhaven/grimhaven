identical zones. Prey of one team is placed in the zone starting room with
Hunters of another team and given a 2 minute head start. After 2 minutes
the Hunters are free to pursue. First team to kill opponent's Prey wins.
Teams will be given a 15000 gold coins budget to buy supplies before each

the team members, not in their inventory, before the hunt begins.

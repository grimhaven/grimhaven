Section 2:

New Mage Academy Erected in Grimhaven

  Over the past few weeks, many citizens of Grimhaven have been struggling 
to cope with the loss of the Mage Academy.  Grief stricken mourners have
huddled over the smoking ruins for weeks.  The tragic fire was the result
of a recent invasion of kobolds.  Late at night when most of the citizens
were asleep, a large army of kobold invaders attacked the city from the
east gate.  Given that in the past it has been impossible to attack the
city from the east, anonymous sources have suggested that rival mages may
have engineered this invasion.  One of the first buildings attacked was the
mage academy.  Not known for their intelligence, the kobold army all died
against the magical defenses erected about the academy.  One by one they
were seen charging into a fiery wall of death set in front of the academy's
entrance.  Unfortunately the wall of lava got out of hand and quickly 
consumed the academy.  Though most of the mages managed to teleport away,
none of them were heard from again.
  This tragic tale appears to have a happy ending.  Refusing to let one 
tragedy cripple the city, the King of Grimhaven has already hired a new
staff of mage instructors.  Through a joint effort of the city construction
forces and the magical powers of the mage instructors, a new and improved
mage academy has been erected.  Today marks the official opening date of
the academy.  Once more young aspiring mages can be seen walking its halls.
The Herald managed to interview the new Head Mage Cosmos about his thoughts
on the new mage school.  He was on hand to say, "Well this new academy just
goes to show you, you can bash a mage, but a good one always gets back up."

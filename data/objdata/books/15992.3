Theories of Folio Thaumaturgy

Despite the obvious social differences between the Book and humanoids, an
enticement of the book towards a desired magical effect can be attempted.  Great
care must be taken, however because a slight misstep could lead to catastrophic
results [1].  The best way is to know which items Marukalia will respond to,
and then place them atop the Book.  Also, it appears that better results may
occur with increased amounts of contribution [2].

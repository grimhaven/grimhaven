SillyMUD code.  In the time since then it has undergone massive changes and

the result of thousands of manhours of coding and building.

But enough bragging, as you are no doubt reading this guide to learn how

Another useful book is the <h> FAQ, available at the local pawn
shop, and well worth the modest price.

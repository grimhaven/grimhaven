Handwritten with beautiful flair, the parchment reads:

     Ah!  My time is old and gone
     but thou hast nearly found me
     My legacy forgotten
     yet my evidence is here to see

     Take these, I have left for thee
     Use them, escape, if need you be
     or save them, until a day you find
     thy enemies are most unkind

     But!  With care thou should take
     as thy blessing is thy fate
     Beginning known - end, none can state

Making the zonefile is one of the last steps in making a zone.  You are
ready to make a zonefile only after you have completed the rooms, mobs and 
objects for your zone.

Zonefiles use a scripting language which is fairly easy to read.  The main
purpose is to inform the mud what to load and where to load it.  It also
handles very simple tasks like making mobs ride each other or closing and
locking of doors.

Zonefiles are generally fairly long.  Additionally, there is no way (at 
present) to do your zonefile online, so you have to write it in an offline
text file for later submission to the Lord of Worlds.  It helps if you
choose an offline editor that can cut and paste.

Action: link
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger 1> { "<arguments 1>";
       <actions>;
     }

<trigger 2> { "<arguments 2>";
       link <trigger 1> <arguments 1>;
     }

The link action allows for a secondary trigger to use the same actions as
another response.  For instance, if you wanted both "say goodbye" and "say
later" to respond in the same fashion, you could link one of them to the other.
eg.  Under "say goodbye" you would detail all the actions that should be
performed.  Then under "say later" you would put a single action:
    link say goodbye;
which when triggered would hand control over to the "say goodbye" action.

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
AFTERMATH OF FRARIN FALLS

As the word of either the treachery or success (depending on which side
the messenger was on) spread, the flames of passion ignited.  By weeks
end, three dozen skirmishes had been fought and hundreds lay dying on
battlefields around the countryside.  As news of the various skirmishes
trickled in, they served to incite increasing amounts of anger.

Galek and Logrus themselves came under persecution.  As the weeks went by and
the war erupted fully around them, the two Faeries were increasingly called
upon to aid their disciples through the use of magik.  The refusal of such
requests (for how could a Faerie bring himself to directly harm another
faeriekin) began to cause a disillusionment amongst the disciples.  The
leadership of both factions was being openly questioned and neither Faerie
knew how to proceed.  And so it was decided that Galek and Logrus would meet
upon a neutral plain near the center of The World.

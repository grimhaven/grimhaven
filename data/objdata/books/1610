General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF DECLINE:

The Faerie power had been waning since the Elves had departed.  The creation of
the Dwarves had weakened them still further and the ill-fated gnome project
had depleted their reserves of Magik.

Worse, The Elders now found themselves being second guessed and even doubted
by the other Faeries.  Factions began to spring up and the Elves were no longer
the only dissenting Faerie group.

The majority still remained true to the old ways, maintaining that the answer
was to force repatriation upon the Elven renegades and their kin.  But a 
sizable minority advocated a full break and that the Faeries would be better
served by returning to the exploration of their magikal powers rather then
dwelling on the Elven problem.  There were even whispered rumors that some
Faeries were even leaning toward the Elven doctrine and some even claimed that
other Faeries had left to become Elves.

It was with powers diminished, reserves depleted, dissent rampant and a lack
of leadership that the Faeries entered the Second Great Age of The World.  With
the Faerie's in a state of confusion, decline and turned toward internal 
affairs, the dwarves, Elves and gnomes were now free to develop without 
influence.

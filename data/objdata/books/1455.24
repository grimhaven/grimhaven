It won't let me move on the diagonals!?!
----------------------------------------
(TinTin and #speedwalk)

A common complaint typically traced to people using a client.  Standard
DIKU's do not have the northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest directions,
hence many clients interpret "ne" as "go north then go east".  This causes
problems on <h> if you mean "ne" as "go northeast".

Under TinTin, you can disable the problem feature by typing
#speedwalk
and turning it OFF.
Alternatively, some people prefer to leave speedwalk on and walk on
the diagonals by using "Ne", "nE" or "NE", etc.

You should probably consult the help files that are with your client if
this doesn't solve the problem.

SOLO ALIGNMENT CHALLENGE RACE:  A race in which a player attempts to
accumulate as many alignment points as possible on his or her own in the
given time limit.  Players will choose their competing characters from any
of their existing PC's.  All competitors will meet at the Mud-Wide
Contestant's Lounge in the area above Grimhaven Center Square unless
another place is designated on the Tournament Board or by mail. 
Competitors will have their experience recorded and then have their Quest
Flags set.  They will then have 1 hour to gain as many alignment points as
they can.  There is no restriction on where players may go to earn these
points, but the same rules against cheating on <h> apply to this
race.  At the end of the hour, the tournament organizer will record your
alignment gain and compare you to other competitors in your level range.

NOTE regarding percentile loads

Percentile loads are an excellent way to control the amount of equipment
that enters the game.  They also randomize what equipment a creature has to
introduce variety into a creature's possession.  Percentile loads are done
using the 'Y' command or some combination involving a '?' command.

There is a tendency among inexperienced builders to avoid or use excessively
high percentile loads.  This results in massive equipment buildups.  THIS
SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  In general, all equipment loading should involve a
percentile load of some sort (possible exception for keys).  That means all
'E' commands should be paired with a '?' before it.

Also, the correct <percent> chances are typically in the range 2-7.  Yes,
I mean 7%.  Yes, really.  Below is a simple chart of the mob having ANY
piece of equipment based on an X chance of equipment on all 17 slots.

17 slots (full equipment minus 2 holds)
1% load percentage --> 1-(0.99)^17  = 15.7% of having some sort of equipment
2% load percentage --> 1-(0.98)^17  = 29.1% of having some sort of equipment
3% load percentage --> 1-(0.97)^17  = 40.4% of having some sort of equipment
4% load percentage --> 1-(0.96)^17  = 50.0% of having some sort of equipment
5% load percentage --> 1-(0.95)^17  = 58.2% of having some sort of equipment
6% load percentage --> 1-(0.94)^17  = 65.1% of having some sort of equipment
7% load percentage --> 1-(0.93)^17  = 70.9% of having some sort of equipment

Hopefully, you'll agree that setting percentage loads of 1-4% is probably
what you want to do.  About the only time you should contemplate a double-digit
percentage is if its for an item that loads on a single mob.

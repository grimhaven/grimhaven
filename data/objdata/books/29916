           <d>The Duties of A Crusader <1>
           <d>In the Knighthood of Aaron <1>

      Thy Crusade hitherto has been to aid and assist
the body of Knighthood itself.  Now having increased
faith and experience within the brotherhood ye are
called to <d>preach the message of truth <1> and love to
all The World.  Go ye therefore hence and be a guide to
all of the realms.  Let thine light shine forth through
<d>example as well as exhortation. <1>

      Herein lies the Duty of a <d>Crusader <1> to 
<d>teach, expound and exhort the doctrine of Galek <1>
<d>and that of the Prophets throughout the ages unto <1>
<d>the people.<1>  It has been said, 
  <d>"Seek ye first to obtain my word, then seek ye to  
     declare it." <1>
      When we feel the happiness and joy that comes from
serving within the order we will want to share that gift
with others.  Firstly, a <d>Crusader <1> must become
familiar with the <d>Eyes of Elyon <1> and the history of
our Brotherhood.  As this foundation is built, one must
also add to it the mortar of our <d>Edicts of Faith <1>
and <d>Tenets of Membership <1> emphasized in previous
callings.  Under the direction of the Apostle Mission
Leader the <d>Crusader <1> must then make it his vision to
share the joy and truth found within these doctrines and
teachings with all creatures of this World.

      With these additional responsibilities a 
<d>Crusader <1> does not lose those initial duties of a
<y>Deacon <1> or of a <c>Teacher <1> which revolve around
visiting with the individual members, strengthening and
fellowshipping with them.  The <d>Home Teaching <1>
program of the <d>Holy Order <1> continues to be of
importance in the life of a <d>Crusader <1>.  He can use
these times to not only to continue getting to know the
different members, but also asking them for the names of
friends they may know who would be interested in their
message.  

      The <d>Knighting <1> of another soul is a great
responsibility and blessing in the lives of a 
<d>Crusader <1>.  After teaching the person and extending
the invitation to join with us in the Brotherhood, a
<d>Crusader <1> must then <d>insure his or her willingness
to serve others <1> both within and without the Order, as
well as <d>sustain <1> the <d>Edicts of Faith and Tenets of
Membership. <1>  Once sure of the sincerity and intent of
an individual a <d>Crusader <1> may then <d>knight him and
ordain him <1> to an office <d>appropriate <1> to not only
their <d>level <1> of experience, but also their <d>degree
of faith <1> .  It may be necessary for a Knight to
proceed through offices normally held by those of
younger nature in order to better prepare for the
fullness of the Knighthood.  When Knighting another, a
<d>Crusader <1> should <d>call that <1>
<d>person by name asking them to kneel; <1>
Assure that they have <d>read, understand and will <1>
<d>commit to the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of <1>
<d>Membership; Laying ones hands or holy blade upon <1>
<d>either the Head (if by hand) or the right shoulder <1>
<d>(if by sword) and stating ones authority as a <1>
<d>Crusader in the Holy Order of Aaron knight the <1>
<d>individual to his or her respective office within <1>
<d>the Holy Order of Aaron.  Then as impressed by ones <1>
<d>feelings, pronounce words of encouragement and <1>
<d>upliftment welcoming them into the Knighthood. <1>
These ceremonies will be the source of great excitement
and rejoicing in the lives of many.  Strive to assure
they are <d>spiritually motivating and reverent. <1>

      Finally, <d>Crusaders <1> must <d>preside over all <1>
<d>meetings of the Knighthood of Aaron.<1>  They are to
<d>conduct and also speak <1> to the body of the Knights
of Aaron.  <d>Crusaders <1> are to gain direction from
their Mission Leader, however they are the Presiding
officers within the Ranks of the Lesser Knighthood of
Aaron.

      The <d>Holy Order <1> thanks you and rejoices in
your calling.  Be clean, strong and honorable.  Lets us
again express our love to you for what you do and what
you stand for.  Let you heart, might, mind and strength
be centered on the sacred office.  

All my love, and thank you <d>Brother <n>,

Vangard Prophet of the Holy Order

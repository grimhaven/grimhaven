Topic: buy
--------------------

Ex:
buy { "<cost> <index> <name>";
	...responses...;
	}

<cost>  = Price to be subtracted from buyer
<index> = Object list number
<name>  = Object name

Ex:
buy { "100 10 orc-leg-stewed";

Would be triggered with:
  buy orc
  buy 10
  buy orc-stewed

Would Not be triggered with:
  buy 1
  buy 1-orc

  The buy command simply allows you to give the mobs a shop
like feel to them.  The <cost> is automatically deducted from
the buyer so no special work is needed in that respects.

An Introduction

The data below was correlated through long hours of study and dissertation
upon the subject of the Book of Power.  The aforementioned object may also be
known as Marukalia, which it wishes itself to be called [1].  It appears to be
a sentient being, although its thoughts and drives are completely different than
any known humanoid race or other organics.  The Book of Power contains powerful
strains of powerful magic, which has the ability to be shaped into many
different manifestations.  Much care is required to make sure that the Book is
never used for the purposes of evil.

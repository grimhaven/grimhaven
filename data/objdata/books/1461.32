Topic: random actions
---------------------

<block> { "<args>";
  ...responses...;
  random <number>;
  randoption 1;
  ...responses...;
  randoption 2;
  ...responses...;
  randoption ...;
  ...responses...;
  donerand;
  ...responses...;
  }

The combination of the three commands "random", "randoption", and
"donerand" makes it possible to perform random interactions in
response to an action.

<number> should be an integer greater than 1.

The numbers after 'randoption' determine to what point the response will
jump.  The commands before the next 'randoption' call will execute.

At any rate, all responses after 'donerand' will execute.

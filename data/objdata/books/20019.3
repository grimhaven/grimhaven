Chapter 3:  Hunting Events

All the events described in this book will take place in the known world
and will test a combination of your skills and your knowledge of the mud. 
The particulars of each event vary and ranges from scavenger hunts to a full
fledge quest.

Description and Rules:  There will be 4 different types of hunts, all of
which are described in detail below.  In all events, except the ITEM HUNT
(see below), each person will be allowed to play 1 and *only* 1 character.
The hunting events will, of course, be continuously monitored by several
gods (so good luck cheating :).  The details of each event are described
below.

Players will assemble at the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the Tournament 
Area above Grimhaven Center Square or in an area designated by a tournament 
organizer prior to the event.  To get to the lounge go up from Center Square 
and follow the signs. Last minute instructions and details will be covered, 
and quick questions and comments will be addressed.  Everyone is expected to 
have read the tournament board and acquired all information regarding their 
chosen event prior to gametime.  Depending upon the event, the players will 
either be divided into groups of their choosing or groups chosen by a god.  
There will be solo events as well.  The player's solo or group quest flags 
will be set and they will be unable to receive help from any outside source 
until the hunt is finished.  Detailed below are descriptions of the various 
hunts.

Any players caught cheating in any way will be immediately disqualified
from all events, have all prizes won revoked, and may be subject to
reduction in level.  Detailed in the other chapters are descriptions and
details of the various races and events.

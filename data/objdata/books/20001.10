Chapter 10:  Signing up, Questions, and other Information

Sign-ups will be done using the <h> mail system.  Make sure you
clearly identify the event name and number.  Address sign-ups to "Fay". 
Questions about events or the tournament can also be addressed to Fay or
posted on the tournament board.  This board is very important to read
since it will contain all updated information.  It may also contain 
information about additional ways to sign-up for events.

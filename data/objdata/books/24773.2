Day 8
Met up with the swamp water lady Elric told me about.
He musta been plenty drunk when he formed his impressions
of her. Nice enough, though, and she's kept me well fed
for days. She taught me a trick with some soap that
should come in handy. I might just stay here. The
frogmen are kinda cute. 

Day 10
That crazy bitch! I had to leave the swamp! Momma's out
looking for me. I had to make a run for it while the 
swamp water lady distracted her.

Day 17
Hiding out with some lizard folks. Showed them the soap
trick. They seemed surprised.

Day 25
Met up with a lonely looking ogre in the jungle. He
seemed to need a guiding hand, and I have been getting
pretty lonely. Hope I'm not lunch.

CAPTURE THE FLAG:  The point is to capture the opponents flag and bring it
back to your home base. Each team will have a domain map they design, the two
domain maps will then be connected by a random playing field map. More
information on this will be given out directly to the registered teams.  
Teams will meet at the Challenge Events Contestants Lounge in the area 
above Grimhaven Town Square at the appointed time unless otherwise posted.

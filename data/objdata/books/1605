General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF CONFLICT:

Committed to bringing about a war, the Faeries devised a scheme whereby a new
race designed to hamper the Elves would be unleashed upon The World.  Faced 
with destruction they theorized, the Elves would have no choice but to seek
the aid of the Faeries, or better yet, to abandon the natural realm completely
and return home to the Faerie realms where they belonged.

A tremendous effort was undertaken, for creation of life itself was not 
something the Faeries had felt was a proper part of their previous knowledge. 
Utilizing massive quantities of raw magik they molded their creation until
finally it was ready.

The Faeries rationalized that the Elves would try and use magik to fight
the Dwarves, as this new race was called, so made the Dwarves intensely
resistant to both natural and unnatural damage.  However, there seemed little 
reason to endow them with great mental powers; in fact, the limited intellect
was seen as a benefit toward making the Dwarves single-minded of purpose.  And
the purpose the Faeries set the Dwarves to was to attack the Elves.

Unsuspecting and with little defense from these vicious sub-creatures, the
Elves in the early days of the struggle took vast losses.  Having been crafted
from magik, the Dwarves had some intrinsic stores of this energy that they
quickly turned to achieving their task.  They learned to sneak up on their 
much more aware adversaries by tunneling, and learned the artform of metallurgy
to produce weapons.

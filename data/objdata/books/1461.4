Trigger:  say
---------------------
 
ex:
say  { "text";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

Say will trigger whenever a person says something matching "text".
Asks or whispers to the response mob will also be handled by this same
response.  Tells and shouts will NOT function due to the global nature
of these commands.

The comparison will be done in a case-insensitive format.  ie, Mountain,
MOUNTAIN, mountain, and MoUnTaIn are all identical.  

"text" will also be checked as a substring against what was actually said.
Thus, if the trigger is "small key" and the person says, "where is the 
small key", the response will trigger.

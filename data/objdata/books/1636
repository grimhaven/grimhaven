General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE ARRIVAL OF LOGRUS

Logrus appeared in the lands on the eastern extreme of civilization.  For his
plan to work, he had to make life as miserable as possible for those around
him, and yet seem to offer a means of escape.  That means was of course a
return to the Faeries home.

He chose a point on the edge of society, relatively untouched by the
centuries of war.  While the groups in this area had their disagreements
with each other, they also were not fenced in with neighbors all around, as
they were on the frontier.  A natural outlet for aggression and expansion
presented itself to these groups, and this kept the area rather stable and
peaceful.  And it was this peace that Logrus wished to destroy.

Logrus's first task was to shut down the borders, so that the region would
slowly feel more constrained and turn in upon itself.  For this task, he
turned to the demihumans.  The demihuman tribes had long been trading
with the civilized creatures, but had never taken full advantage of the
situation.  Traders freely exchanged arms and weapons with these groups,
and the demihumans had more often then not used these items in their
clan battles for internal dominance.  Had the demihumans ever turned those
weapons outward at the command of a leader, Logrus realized he could
threaten the entire structure and fabric of civilization.

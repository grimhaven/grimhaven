Chapter IV: The Spine of the Coils.

	No coils can be intact without a spine. The spine of the Serpent
is made of individuals in power. There will be a main neck piece for the
spine which will be the main leader. Right below it is the back spine, the
second in command to the neck piece. He will always be supporting and
ready to do his bidding, never able to contradict his leaders order but
always able to speak his argument, thus enforcing the Coils of Discipline
and Balance. Naturally, attached to the spine, both of equal power and
status, although low it maybe since the ribs of the Serpent are very short
and close to the spine. They will both answer to the Neckspine and the
Backspine. The powers of the ribs is in their ability to reach to the body
further than the spines, thus providing the diversity to the spine and the
connection to the body through the reach of the inner parts. They may
advise the spine on issues regarding the Order. Orders from the
neck piece will always be followed by all unless all is against them, in that
case they will be neutralized and not countered. Orders from the Backspine
will always be followed by the ribs unless both disagree and in that case
they will be neutralized too and not countered. Beware of disobeying
orders carelessly, the consequences on the body will be great and the
wrath of the spines is nothing to make fun of. With this system, all the
body will be in harmony with the Coils, and our goals will be achieved. Any
member of the body going out of order will cause this harmony to fall
apart and thus will gain the rage and anger of all the body. Remember the
Serpent always changes its skin when it sees it fit.

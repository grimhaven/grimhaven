Races of <h>
------------------

SneezyMUD's basic races are: human, ogre, gnome, hobbit, elf and dwarf.
Anyone may choose to create one of these races and equipment for most races
and classes are relatively plentiful, especially for humans.

SneezyMUD's extended races are: ????, orc, gnoll and ????.
Anyone may choose to create one of these races, but it is suggested that the
player be a somewhat experienced MUDder, as these races all have unique traits
that affect gameplay.  Equipment for some of these races is not as easily 
available as it is for the basic races.

SneezyMUD's advanced races are: troll, ????, aarakocra and ????.
These races are only available to experienced SneezyMUD players and are "unlocked"
by having a certain number of level 50 characters in your account.  These races
all have enhanced characteristics and special traits that greatly affect game-
play.  Equipment for some of these races is not as easily available it is for
the basic races.

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE END OF THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD

More than a hands-breadth of centuries would pass with the status quo becoming
increasingly entrenched.  Some progress occurred to say the least, but for the
most part, civilization had become profoundly stagnant.  Worse, it was being
raped of its useful products by sub creatures that should never have seen the
light of day.

The Third Age is most notable for the establishment of civilization.  And while
this civilization proved less glorious then was possible, it was nonetheless a
tremendous advancement over the marginally nomadic existence the enclaves had
used during the Second Age.

It is also of note that the five civilized races began to cooperate one with
each other (excepting elves and dwarves).  Where once it was unheard of for
members of three separate races to be in one place, by the close it was so
common place as to be unnoticeable.

Lastly, it is during the Third Age that humanity came into its own as an
equal.  The development of civilization went a long way towards achieving this,
but there are numerous and unmentioned cases where humanity led the way during
the Third Age.

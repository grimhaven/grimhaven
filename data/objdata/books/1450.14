The existing mud:

Changing anything in the existing mud is something you should not contemplate
until you are experienced and have been explicitaly cleared to do so. Be
EXTREMELY careful making exits.

If you DO accidentally mess up the real mud, tell someone ASAP.  It is far
better to have the problem corrected BEFORE it means doing a reimbursement,
then to have to do the reimbursement and then have to go check the logs to
see which dumb immortal screwed up the mud and didn't even bother to tell
someone about it.

This does mean though that you should NOT connect your work-in-progress zone
to the existing mud.  The connection is normally done by the Lord of Worlds
as the final act of zone making and corresponds to making the zone active.
Until the zone is declared ready to be made active, it should not be hooked
to the existing mud.

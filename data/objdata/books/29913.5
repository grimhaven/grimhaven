The Pantheon of Logrus

       Since as long as the Cult has recorded our history, three deities
have dominated the worship of the religious sect led by the Logrus
Master.

1) Malshyra, Bringer of Glory, Patroness of Conquerers

Malshyra is the chief deity of the Cult of Logrus. She represents good
fortune in any endeavor, success in any conflict. It is a well
established ritual to thank Malshyra for any victory that was in doubt;
to fail to do so it to incur her wrath. She often appears as a beautiful
woman surrounded by a nimbus of bright light, or in war, as a terrible
warrior dressed in a suit of black platemail, with the visor drawn over
her features, wielding a sword of black flame.

2) The Shrouded Deity, Scourge of the Weak, Deity of Disease, the Dead, and
Decay.

Shroud is appeased, feared, but rarely worshiped. He represents the
ultimate fate of the weak, and what the strong are required to overcome.
To declare someone a weakling is often done by the curse of calling
someone "Shroud's Own". Shroud is not usually depicted as humanoid; he
commonly appears as a swirling cloud of darkness with tendrils reaching
for victims, a single red-fanged maw occasionally seen through the
darkness. His voice is that of a thousand tormented screams guided by a
malevolent mind. He is the brother of Jevon.

3) Lesprit, Deity of Desire.

Lesprit represents want, desire, and motivation. She, along with
Malshyra, is often prayed to for the granting of wishes - Malshyra is
often asked for aid in military campaigns, however, while Lesprit is
most often venerated when one wants a personal desire granted. She is
quite fickle, but few have ever scorned Lesprit - to do so is to never
most often venerated when one wants a personal desire granted. She is
quite fickle, but few have ever scorned Lesprit - to do so is to never
know pleasure again in life. Lesprit is often represented by coins, with
a rose and a sword lying atop the pile - this shows the three chief
reasons she is often invoked - for money, love, or vengeance. A common
saying among the Cult when musing is... "May Lesprit grant that I...",
or such like. She is a very popular deity. When she appears upon the
world, no one has ever quite been able to describe her; she simply
appears as what one would most desire in a mate, whether this would make
her male or female. Lesprit is loved by both Omnon of the Brotherhood,
and Icon of the Serpents.

4) Talana the Lawgiver, deity of punishment and discipline.

Talana is the friend of authority. She is not a representation of
justice, but of obedience, subservience, and the punishment that
results from rebellion. She is always invoked in legal proceedings of
the Cult, or during any disciplinary action. It is said that Talana
hates the weak defeating the strong by luck, and will often crush
uprisings herself. She is the daughter of Elyon of the Brotherhood (the
mother is not currently known), and seems to be a personification of law
without mercy, twisting Elyon's concept of Justice. She is often
represented by a clenched mailed fist. When she appears, she is a
beautiful, blond-haired woman with glowing red eyes, dressed in a
burnt-black suit of platemail. She holds a two-handed sword in front of
her while talking, but is very quick to use it to destroy any who oppose
her. Her voice is surprisingly sweet and quiet, but she will scream in
anger when any argue with her.

5) Salurel, deity of Pride

Pride is not a negative attribute to the Cult of Logrus. It is a simple,
firm declaration of one's abilities, a demonstration that one is
Superior, and as such, is admired. Salurel is the deity of Pride, and
smiles upon those who are Superior. She is intensely personal, giving
those who have potential to be great the ability to realize that
potential. Anyone who becomes arrogant, or brags of abilities that they
do not have, is often accused of "stealing from Salurel" - acquiring her
pride without any of her gifts. Hubris is not considered a sin, as it is
simply extreme pride - arrogance, unfounded pride, is a sin. Salurel is
prayed to by parents of a child, by leaders for their servants, and the
like. She is represented by an ornate, golden mirror. When she appears
as a human, she is otherworldly beautiful, unspeakably majestic - her
hair and features are often partially obscured by a blinding light that
surrounds her. She moves with perfect grace, but her voice is booming
with authority, seeming to come from all sides of the listener.

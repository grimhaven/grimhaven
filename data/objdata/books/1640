General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE CULT OF LOGRUS

As Logrus's teachings spread, and came into practice, his followers became
known as the Cult of Logrus.  True to his words, Logrus managed the early Cult
with an iron hand, and required all his leaders to do likewise.  Discipline was
strict from Logrus on down to the most common dragoon at the bottom of the
chain.  But slowly they began to turn the tide against both the demihuman and
Crime Lord aggressors.

Logrus instituted a system of rules of conduct to be followed by his
sub leaders, as well as a mantra of expectations that any follower was
expected to bring about for his leader.  He set high standards, but by
his words, the dangerous times demanded it.  Justice was summary and
swift.  Failure from a follower was intolerable to a leader, such people
were commonly made to serve side by side with the captured enemies
made into slave labor.  A harsh and disciplined peace was established.

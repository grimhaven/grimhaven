INTRODUCTION

The main differences between earlier <h>s and this version are in the
race, stat, skill learning, and discipline systems.  Additionally, there are
geographical changes, and changes to the way some skills work, as well as
modifications to mage damage, faction code, how lag applies to casters. 
Other numerous smaller changes can be found listed in help files and in
the news. Lastly, there have been upgrades to utility functions like
color, auto, score and attribute. Combat formulas have been changed to
eliminate the tie-in between damage and weapon weights.  Combat relies
more on the players skill than the innate damage of the weapon he uses.

The use of Rent to control inventory levels is back in the MUD, and
factions will be implemented in full this version. High level experience
has been lowered somewhat and the classes are more balanced. The Azruzi
class has been taken out of the MUD and will be replaced by the Shaman
class soon after opening. Some of the classes are being made to
integrate better in groups than in past versions and there is an impetus
to getting more warriors of various races.

Most of the changes you will notice because they are obvious or because
they are in the help files. The rest of this document will be devoted to
general overview and to giving the rationales and reasons behind some of
the new systems and answering some of the frequently asked questions about
how and why we did things the way we did it. 

Please understand that a lot has changed. You may or may not like all of
the new structures although we hope you do.  All of them were designed to
try to adjust for perceived flaws and inconsistencies in past versions. We
believe that the new structures generally upgrade the MUD and respond to
player raised complaints, wishes and gripes. It is a given that we won't
please everyone with these changes, and we will have new problems, wishes
and gripes (and hopefully some compliments). Our long beta period has
worked through many of these problems which is the one thing we can thank
about our long beta.  We are also sure that we will find things we wished
we had implemented with this version as well. However, we hope and believe
that you will find this version a lot of fun. 

Last, we wish to again thank all the beta testers that have given
invaluable assistance in working out bugs and inconsistencies over the last
year.

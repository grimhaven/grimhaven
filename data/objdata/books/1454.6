The 'O' command
Load objects

This command loads items directly into the room.  It is generally used to 
insert furniture into the room.  All 'O' commands are only executed at
boot_time  (when the game reboots).  All furniture loads should be 
bunched together and follow your door (D) commands.  

Sample usage:

O <if_flag> <obj vnum> <number> <room vnum>

<if_flag> is generally 0  (always load)
<obj vnum> is the vnum that you saved the object as.
<number> number of objects to load in the room
<room vnum> is the vnum of the room to put the object in.

example:
O 0 100 9 103             guard's cots
O 0 100 9 104
O 0 100 9 105

These commands load cots successively in rooms 103, 104, 105.  Comment the
item (100) only once and keep all loads for the item together.  


NOTES:

USING OBJECTS FROM OTHER ZONES:  You are able to use simple objects from
other zones in your zones.  However, you should not use *any* limited
items from other zones in your zones.  Understand that your loading of
such objects may interfere with loading in other zones if the items are
limited.  Moreover, you should inform the LOW on zone file submission if 
you are using items from other zones.

*All new equipment created by the builder such as weapons and armor must be
informed to the LOW _BEFORE_ it's creation.  You will save yourself a lot of
work if you inform the LOW.  This is not to say new item's will be denied
but this policy is to ensure balance within the game.

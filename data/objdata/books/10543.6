Section 6:

Prairie Cowboys Rebuild Saloon

  Hikers from the City of Brightmoon have commented on the recent 
reconstruction of the nearby saloon.  The ranchers and cowboys of the area
have joined together to revitalize the abandoned saloon by Norman's Road.
It now provides a nearby supply of liquor for those long days on the
prairies, and some entertainment for the long nights.  Though this recent
construction has increased the number of reported alcohol-related incidents
in the area, most cowboys will agree that it has done a wondrous thing for
local morale.  When asked about the implications of a new saloon in the
area for attracting more cowboys to the Norman's Road area, a cowboy was on
hand to reply, "Well I'm not sure about all that, but as far as the saloon
goes, *spit* it sure is perty!"

Section 7:

New Elven Race Rumored to Have Been Found

  Just when everyone thought that every possible race of elf had been
classified, Mother Nature has once more proven The World wrong.  The
recently discovered dry well in the Norman's Road area has led to startling
discoveries.  Reports along the Brightmoon/Lionheart area suggest that a
new race of elf exists.  Hikers traveling out of Mordant's Deep claim to
have spotted a pair of elves without facial features skulking near the
well.  A returning "business man" from Lionheart claimed to have spotted a
similar looking elf at night.  Recent attempts to make contact with this
allegedly new elven race has proven futile for they have refused to make
contact thus far.  Ranger scouts from Mordant's Deep warn travelers not to 
attempt to make contact for other unsavory creatures also seem to inhabit
the area of the dry well.   The last expedition has discovered that the
well had been abandoned due to its loss of water, but was later used by
other creatures as a living area.  Though no further expeditions have been
commissioned, it is hoped that this possible new race will attempt to make
contact with local representatives.  Augustine, the Proctor of Brightmoon
has made the official statement, "We shall respect this new race's privacy
but it is my sincere hope that they will one day join us as a part of the
world-wide community."

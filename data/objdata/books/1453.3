Planning: Mapping

Now that you know what you're making it's time to start mapping. Get some
graph paper and a pencil and map the surrounding areas of your zone. You can
do that with your mortal. This makes connecting your zone to the world a lot
smoother later in the game.

The easiest way to do it is to draw a box to represent each room and have lines
connecting the boxes to represent room exits. Mark exits with door and secrets
somehow. Also note rooms that are out of the ordinary, like air rooms, rivers etc.

It's very important you number your rooms somehow. It's also wise to number them
using the same room numbers available to you. You can check what these are with
the GOTO HELP command. Start from left to right, top to bottom accros the page
or something, in a way that makes sense to you.

The mapping step is very important as you'll be referring back to it a lot
during the building process.

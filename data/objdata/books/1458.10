<h> Characteristics
-------------------------

The HELP CHARACTERISTICS file contains good background information on
what characteristics are, and what they affect.  Since there is a lot
of information in there for the Newbie, here are the things to consider.

Base characteristics are locked in at character generation time.  New players
are encouraged to set some characteristics and try them out, you will
undoubtedly want to experiment with some numbers before finally committing
yourself to any one setup.  Accept the fact that you may have to create a
number of characters before you get a set of characteristics you will be happy
with happy with over your whole career.

There is no "perfect" setup for characteristics.  This is largely an exercise
in personal preference and making acceptable tradeoffs.  On a final note, it
is not advisable to set as many characteristics to max as possible; you will
find that a near maxed characteristic is virtually identical to the maxed
quantities, while the sacrificed characteristics vary radically at the low
numbers (ie., diminishing returns).  That is, it may not be advantageous to
max a stat in detriment of others, you may suffer rather then benefit in the
end.

Lastly, realize that the natural and adjusted characteristics are the two key
ones.  If you chose a race that has a high natural strength, you probably do
NOT need to raise that strength further with your chosen characteristics.
This is a common mistake, usually made because of ignorance.  Example:
I want to make a warrior.  Warriors need good brawn.  If I am human, I will
probably want to put points into brawn since humans aren't that brawny.
However, if I opt for a dwarf or an ogre, I can get away without adding
more brawn points.  In fact, such a warrior may want to DECREASE their
brawn, in order to have spare points to offset the penalties those races have
in things like agility and dexterity.

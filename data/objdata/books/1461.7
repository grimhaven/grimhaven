Trigger: socials
---------------------
 
ex:
<social> { "<none | self | me | other>";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

All socials (puke, smile, etc) will operate as triggers.  Put the social you
wish to have used in for <social>.

The trigger arguments may be "none", "self", "me" or "other".  These may be
used in combination, eg. "none other" will be triggered for either none or
other.

As you are aware, socials may take arguments.  For example, I can smile, or I
can smile at somebody.  The first is the situation where the user does not
specify a target (User smiles.).  This situation triggers if "none" is in
the trigger arguments.  The "self" condition operates if user does the social at
himself (User smiles at himself.)  The "me" operates if the trigger mob is
the one the social is targeted at.  The "other" condition is basically if
user has done the social on someone other than the response mob or himself.

Realize some socials are set up so that they can't be done without arguments
(wave, thank) or can't be done with arguments (burp, snore).  Use common
sense when devising trigger arguments for the various socials.

   When greatest is the fury of the storm,
   Combine together these ingredients so a potion they form,
   First the home the fuzzy worm takes when learning to fly,
   Then a loop of hide, at the bottom of the pot it must lie,
   Now a piece of hair from the animal most ridden,
   All the while speaking to those forces that must remain hidden.

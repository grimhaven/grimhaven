General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF RIFT:

For a people as similar in purpose and as long in memory as the Faeries to
not understand something was a profound problem.  It had been millennium since
a puzzle had been presented to them, and it was only in their earliest
recollections that a problem to which they did not see the solution instantly
could be found.  Gradually, The Elders concern grew into anger and finally into
intolerance.

An ultimatum was delivered, give up the mad teachings and return to their
roots or be exiled forever - and to the Faeries, forever was the only increment
of time that they had not yet experienced.

The dissidents were faced with a problem and they too could not see the
solution.  Give up their beliefs and way of life, or forsake their heritage.
Half of the former dissidents chose the latter course of action.

The elven historians say it was this outlaw band of Faeries that formed the
First Tribe (the High Ones).  The Elders final act of spite was to strip these
Elves of much of their magikal powers before casting them near defenseless
into the hostile and natural World.

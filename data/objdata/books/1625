General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE SHERCADIAN PLAN

It took a full year from the end of the conference of Shercadia until each race
had agreed to this bizarre plan.  In the end, it was agreed that a human race
bonded with the responsible genetics of the faeriekin would be not only less a
threat, but better able to be exploited.  The literature that remains from this
era shows signs that each race hoped to use the neo-humans for their own
purposes, and discussed them mostly in terms of slaves or at best, subject
vassals.  While history would prove the humans would vastly improve the
civilized races, the patronizing attitudes the Four Races had for humans would
later come back to haunt them, but that is a tale for another time.

And so it came to pass that each race sent members to the gnomelands to be
utilized in the plan.  The elven ambassador offered her intellect and love of
The World, the dwarves their steadfast dedication to the goal at hand, and
the hobbits offered their curiosity and inquisitiveness.  To this, the gnomes
bonded their own wise nature.

It was introduced into humanity according to the plan and quickly achieved its
desired effect.  For the neo-humans were indeed superior to their barbaric
cousins and in addition, bore the traits they had been gifted from the gnome
technicians.

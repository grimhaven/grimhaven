Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your archery skills
using moving targets.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant
character to participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you
will meet with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details
and assign you this color and this contestant character. 

Upon logging your color-coded character in, the tournament organizer will
give you a special tournament bow and arrow set.  This weapon has been
specially designed to kill special "prey" characters in one hit.  Gods or
other contestants will log in "prey" characters who have been set so that
one hit from your arrows will kill them.  Your mission if you choose to
accept it will be to kill three of these "prey" characters and bring their
heads to the tournament organizer. 

The event will take place in color-coded square tournament pits.  They are
well lit and contain no surprises.  These pits range in size from 25 rooms
to 100 rooms.  Each pit has an exit back to the tournament organizer. 
Only one wall will have this exit, but it will be clearly marked in every
room description. 

The prey characters will enter the pit before you and from a different
directions.  They may be gods they may be other contestants.  In either
case, they will try to avoid you and your arrows.  They shall flee 
your wrath and skill often and fast.  You shall show them no mercy.

The prey will die in one hit from your arrows.  In the corpse you will
find a head.  When you have collected a specified number of heads run for
the exit and give the head(s) to the judge who will have timed you.  The
winner of a heat will be the contestant with the fastest time.  The event
will also have a time limit of 10 minutes in which case the winner will be
the contestant with the most heads.  Ties will be resolved in a run off
heat. 

This event will be run in heats.  You will be grouped randomly in two
groups of four (4).  The contestants with the two top times in each of
these groups will then be put into another group.  These four contestants
will compete against each other in a second heat.  The tournament 
organizer will add the contestants times in both the first and second 
heats to determine the event winner and runner-up.  


May the best hunter win.

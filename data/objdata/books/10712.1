                        "The Ego of the Dragons"

  Let our tale begin here dear Scholar.....

   Old and tired, a true immortal, if there is such a thing, felt his 
creations fading away and his children fearful and dying.  With a last 
effort he gathered those favored of his children and sought to save them.  
Using a great deal of his remaining will the creator took his chosen and
placed them on The World of another creator amid a remote continent.  
Exhausting himself but not wanting to lose himself the creator slept
hoping to conserve himself and at the same time dwell on a way to 
watch his children grow.

   His children, those we term dragons, soon found that they in their
magical nature were far superior to those previous inhabitants of the
continent they had found themselves on.  Soon they sought to control
these "frail" humans they encountered, those of good seeking to rule 
and control over them feeling it was for the humans own good while 
those of an evil nature simply considered them their play things. Soon 
this domination evolved into a power struggle between those good and
evil dragons.  Its conclusion was brought about as the leaders of each
group sought outright conflict and the others destruction.  

   The battle was above the comprehension of the human mind.  It lasted 
what seemed an eternity, and brought about the destruction of the 
majority of the continent.  In its final conclusions the dragons magic,
alien to this new world, consumed both dragons.  As the dragons were
consumed by their own magic its effect on the continent itself was
devastating.  The magic unleashed became uncontrollable and spread across 
the continent alter everything in its path and leaving chaos in its 
wake.  Entire races perished while others were altered and changed.  
Mountains were leveled and new seas rushed in to fill the lowlands.
And after it was over the magic remained, constantly altering the lands
and avoiding almost all attempts to tame it.  The dragons though, being
creatures of this magic were unaffected by it, using and breathing it
as if it were air.  After the destruction of the two leaders, the 
dragons fearful of what the creator would do, sought out places of 
refuge.  So for some time they hid within their lairs fearful of the 
creators wrath and bickered and cast blame upon each other as to whose 
fault the destruction was.  All the while civilizations were created
and destroyed as the magical chaos swept over the land.

And so it was for decades....

The Order of the Serpent

       Power without wisdom is a dangerous thing. While we seek strength
so that we might improve The World, and the Brotherhood of Galek
Brightmoon pursue vague ideals so that they might weaken The World,
these people seem to be guided by nothing other than common greed. They
are utterly mundane and artless, never transcending the limitations of
Inferior people. It seems utterly tragic that those who seek to gather
power and wealth would do so not so that they might improve The World,
but rather, to make it a goal of itself. In essence, they are without
purpose. Use these pathetic fools, show them your contempt, and toss
them aside. They need not be destroyed, merely ignored, and if possible,
converted. Those who believe in nothing are very quick to see the Truth,
when shown it.

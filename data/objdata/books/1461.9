Action: tovict
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       tovict <string>;
       <other actions>;
     }

The tovict action is an advanced emote or echo command.  It will send <string>
to just the person doing performing the trigger.  In general, any place you use
a tovict action should also have a tonotvict action for everyone else.

The beauty of tovict is that it allows you to use replacement characters
that will be filled in when it is actually performed based on who did the
trigger and with what.

Replacement strings:
$n  = the trigger-mobs name
$e  = "he", "she" or "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$m  = "him", "her", "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$s  = "his", "hers", "its" based on sex of trigger-mob

performer = person who triggered the action
$N  = the performer's name
$E  = "he", "she" or "it" based on sex of performer
$M  = "him", "her", "it" based on sex of performer
$S  = "his", "hers", "its" based on sex of performer

$o  = the first word in the name of the trigger-object (for give)
$p  = the full name of the trigger-object

Example:
tovict $n puts $s hand on your back.
becomes
A lazy thief puts his hand on your back.

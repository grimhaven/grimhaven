Room Height

Room height is in inches.  Room height is used to make narrow spaces and 
cause coded affects in players.   For example, a player can only crawl 
into a room if he/she is 110% taller than the room height.  The code will 
also cause tall players to bump their heads causing some damage if they 
enter small rooms.  You must set outdoor rooms unlimited height (-1) 
and set a room height for indoor heights (normal height is about 120).

NOTES:

RELATION TO MOB HEIGHT:  You must set your room heights in expectation of
what mobs you are going to have occupy them and what players you want
playing them.  Room height must also be set in relation to flee/track
paths for large mobs and wander paths for large non-sentinel mobs.  For
example, if you are going to have a dragon in a cave.  You must build the
path to the inside cave of sufficient height so the dragon can get to the
surface. 

REQUIRED SETTINGS:   You must set outdoor rooms to unlimited room 
heights. You must not have unlimited heights in indoor rooms.  

RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:  The most common room heights are 120 for inside 
rooms if you are not trying to have a restricted room and unlimited for 
outdoor rooms.

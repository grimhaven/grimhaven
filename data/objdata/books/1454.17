The '?' command
give following command a random probability

This is a command you should use extensively, especially where equipment
is concerned.

? 0 <chance> 0 <command>

Note that what is usually the if_flag is not important and can be ignored.
Additionally, don't miss the 2nd 0.  This 2nd zero MUST be a 0.

<chance> is how many chances out of 100 it has of occurring.
    for equipment use values in the range 3-7 for restricted stuff
                                          8-15 for plentiful items
                                          20+ is exceptionally high
<command> is what to apply it to

M 0 100 0 103        orc
? 0 10 0 E
E 1 103 1 19            sword

Loads the orc (vnum 100) into room 103 then gives it a 10% chance of having
a sword (vnum 103) in its hand (slot 19).  Note the E command still needs to
pass the check on max_exist as well.

Note: ANY command that a '?' is operating on should have an if_flag of 1
This is so the command does NOT operate if the ? didn't work.

example 1:
M ....
? 0 10 0 E
E 1 ....
E 1 ....

This causes it to look at the ? command.  If the ? passes, it will load all of
the E below it.

example 2:
M ....
? 0 10 0 E
E 1 ....
? 0 10 0 E
E 1 ....

This looks at the first ?, if it passes it will load the first piece of eq.
Regardless of whether the first piece of eq loaded (successful 1st ? and
sufficient max_exist) it will do a new roll for the second ?.  The chief 
difference is example 1 will cause it to have a ton of stuff when the ? passes
while the second example (preferred method) will give it a shot at everything
possible  (1: all or nothing, 2: randomized)

      <d>The Book of Morianton<1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>Oh ye fair ones, how could ye have departed 
from the ways of Galek! 
O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected
he who stood with open arms to receive you!
Behold, if ye had not done this ye would not have fallen.
But behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.
<y>2. <1>My soul is rent in anguish, 
because of the slain of our people.
Oh ye fair sons and daughters,
ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones,
How is it that ye could have fallen!
But behold, ye are gone, 
and my sorrows can not bring your return.

<y>3. <1>Yea, now because of my injuries I must soon go down 
to my grave, and my spirit to those that gave me life.  
<y>4. <1>Oh that ye might remember the words of your Prophet.
Oh that ye may never forget his gift to you.
<y>5. <1>In the days of my youth I remember sitting at his feet
listening to the wisdom and love embodied in his teachings.
<y>6. <1>Verily he taught us whence we came, our noble birthright!
Indeed he founded our belief in the Great Creator of The World.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>In those days we lived in peace.  
Even those wicked Logrites who sought to oppress 
and sit upon their thrones in decadence were encompassed in his love
and given freedom to worship as they saw fit 
the filthy lucre of The World.  
<y>2. <1>Yea he said, 

<d>"For verily verily I say unto you,
<d>it is given to all men that they might choose for themselves, <1>
<d>whether it be morality and virtue or the pain of greed. <1>
<d>I exhort you my brethren, be honest, true, chaste, benevolent <1>
<d>and do good to all men." <1>

<y<y>. <1>Galek has given us those commandments to teach us the truth,
and to prepare us for that day when we might return home.

  <d>"The worth of the individual is great in mine eyes.
  <d>For all mankind has a common creator and innate glory. <1>
  <d>Each of us is endowed with wisdom and personal responsibility <1>
  <d>or the welfare of ourselves and others. <1>
  <d>ove conquers our carnal desires to limit personal freedoms <1>
  <d>and the agency of one another. <1>
  <d>Oh that I could teach you this one principle, <1>
  <d>that the purpose of ones life is discovered only in the losing of it.   <1>
  <d>Learn to serve one another in whatever manner possible. <1>
  <d>Then you will realize that when ye are in the service <1>
  <d>of your fellow man ye are only in the service of your creator." <1>

<y>Chapter 3 <1>

<y>1. <1>Those were days of beauty.  
<y>2. <1>Now there are only the fallen bodies of the Noble Guardians.
Perhaps their sacrifice has been the greatest of all.
For they truly fought for freedom.
<y>3. <1>Yea they truly fought to liberate our friends the Tytans
from the bondage of slavery.
<y>4. <1>Behold! they sacrificed their lives for another.
<y>5. <1>Oh that I could smite down that foul city 
with the rod of my masters word.
<y>6. <1>Alas,  I must soon return to the dust of the ground,
however, I will not forget Frarin Falls 
as long as my soul continues to exist.

<y>Chapter 4 <1>

<y>1. <1>I can remember the morning Dagendar 
came bleeding to the gates of Brightmoon,
for thus was our noble stronghold named.
<y>2. <1>His wounds were sever and were it not for the swift aid of our clerics
I fear he too would have perished.
<y>3. <1>The suffering he detailed was appalling.
<y>4. <1>The Guardian of the Steps was up in arms almost immediately
gathering his troops for our first offensive upon the forces of Logrus.
<y>5. <1>The words of the prophet fell upon deaf ears
as the Paladin guards assembled before the Cathedral.

<d>"For it cometh to pass that whosoever buildeth up 
<d>secret combinations to overthrow <1>
<d>the freedom of all lands, nations and countries; <1>
<d>and seeketh to bring destruction upon all races, <1>
<d>the same is built up by Logrus, who is the father of all lies;  <1>
<d>even that same liar who beguiled our brethren a century ago, <1>
<d>yea even that same liar who has caused Man <1>
<d>to commit murder and subjugate one another, <1>
<d>and hath hardened their hearts to truth! <1>
<d>Yes, Galek has taught us that we must respect another's wishes, <1>
<d>that they mayest respect ours, <1>
<d>but I say unto you he hath also said <1>
<d>we must eliminate oppression! <1>
<d>We must free these souls from slavery. <1>
<d>If we do not we are not worthy of the title Knight, <1>
<d>nor is it permissible that we bear the name of a Galekian. <1>
<d>Men I pray thee, gather together thy strength <1>
<d>and follow me to victory!" <1>

Yea, and so it was said by the commander Melchizedek.
<y>6. <1>Much to the dismay of our Prophet the people of Brightmoon
were united behind our leader and Defender of the Steps.  
Their hearts were full of rage despite his attempts to calm them.
In the end he was quieted by chants of freedom
and saw that this must be.

<y>Chapter 5 <1>

<y>1. <1>Now he is gone.  I fear that we are as well.
<y>2. <1>Yea, we have unleashed through our anger
an even greater evil, the spawn of hell itself.
<y>3. <1>I know not what manner of Daemon has vanquished our Prophet, 
but his ruthlessness was enough to overcome 
even his desperate summoner Logrus.

<y>4. <1>Oh ye fair ones;
Ye Knights of Galek;
How could ye have departed?

AFTERWORD

In addition to continued general coding and world building, the
implementors are aware of the following changes that can be expected
within version 5.0:

Shaman Class: The implementors plan on adding a shaman class to the mud
which will have the following features: brewing, drain spells, undead
pets, tasked healing.

Mage Class: Mages will have more complexity coded into the class. Damage
and duration amounts will be affected by weather and sector.  Mage
protection spells will also become more important when fighting a casting
mobile.

Cleric Class: Offensive prayers will be converted to tasking. Afflictions
will go through some changes in that most of the afflictions will be made
of short term duration.

Warrior Class: Smythe should finally be implemented although with some
limits.

Skills: Generally, we expect continued coding of detail into skills over
the next year including taking even better advantage of our discipline and
learning system.

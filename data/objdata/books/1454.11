The 'E' command
Equip a mob with an object

The 'E' command gives an item to the last mob referenced

E <if_flag> <obj vnum> <max_exist> <slot>

<if_flag> is typically 1   (only if the mob it should be given to exists)
<obj vnum> is vnum obj is saved as
<max_exist> load if fewer than this # of item in world 
	- see note on end for tips on setting
<slot> is the slot to put the item in.  see notes on slot at end

M 0 100 4 102        orc
E 1 105 10 1             aluminum ring

These commands would load an orc and then put a ring on his finger (slot 1).
See the list at the end for what slots are what.  It only will equip if the mob
loaded.  Indent the comment for the object slightly from the comment regarding
the mob.

TIP: if you are using 'G' and 'E' in conjunction, put all the 'G's before you
do 'E's.

NOTE:   Mobs are LEFT handed, put weapons on left (unless paired), shields 
        on right.
NOTE:   All paired items go on RIGHT!
NOTE:   Do not have a dual-wielding mob!  Dual-wield causes them to have
        twice as many attacks as was defined on the mob.  (THIS IS BAD)
NOTE:   Don't assign multiple items to the same slot.  You can not have
        a mob pick (probably randomly via '?') from a set of weapons.
        The exception to this rule is that you CAN mix bulk loads and general
        loads so that a mob can wear a given helm (specific), and be
        fleshed out on all other slots with chain (bulk).

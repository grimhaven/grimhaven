BLIND RACE:  This race will be held in a brand new zone so all have a fair
and equal chance of winning.  Players will be given a clue to find a
certain room.  It won't be obvious so reading the room descriptions will
be necessary.  Contestants should meet in the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge
in the Area above Grimhaven Center Square unless otherwise posted.  
Transportation will be arranged to the event zone.

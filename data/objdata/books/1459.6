SKILL SETS, DIVERSITY, and PRE_REQUISITES

Players pre requisites have been centralized and this has allowed the
classes to be much more ordered and balanced at lower to mid levels.  This
was the primary motivation for the changes in these areas.  

In 4.1, a caster would get a spell that was designed for a level 15 mage
at level 5.  He would learn a spell like gust after that one rather than
before.  No spells were learned at the appropriate time except by
coincidence.  This caused us to put in complex pre-requisites and to put
weird things into classes to try to catch up to the weird skill sets. This
meant that in general, <h> 4.1 casters were identical between levels 20
and 25 because of pre requisites and unbalanced both before and after
those levels.  

Ultimately, the idea of full choice of skills at low levels is a balance
nightmare and, ultimately, we never even saw the diversity that was the
primary benefit desired by that system.  At low levels, there were clearly
preferred paths for every class because not every discipline can be equal.
The only people who didn't know were Newbies who didn't know better.  It is
very difficult to both give choice and make everything equal and make it
understandable.  We believe it is not possible to do that and maintain
balance.

We have substituted diversity in actual learning, racial diversity, and
have added meaningful specialization in place of diversity in practices. 
Specializations have meanings in the 5.0 systems where you do not max a
discipline in 8 levels of practice but must both use the skill and pick
the specialty when you get out of basic.  Every skill and spell is
associated with advanced disciplines and specialization will change the
affects of basic skills.  Some of these affects will be apparent (see help
files for some affects) some invisible and structural.  Using a skill will
increase your abilities of even basic skills in those specialties.  Know
that there are diversities in identically practiced players based on their
choices in using skills.  At higher levels, people will actually get
different skill sets as they sink practices into the advanced disciplines.

The above will explain why some advanced disciplines have no apparent
skills.  We hope to eventually have skills in every one but the discipline
learning has an independent affect.

In any event, please understand the reason why your low level choices are
more restricted.  It is so no character learns meaningless skills at
inappropriate levels.  Restricting choice was not our goal but the
trade-off for what we tried to accomplish.  It has allowed us to
immediately make the ranger and mage classes playable and it will allow us
to balance skills and classes easily against each other.

We believe that this will be more understandable to new comers to <h>
and increases the over-all enjoyability of the mud.  In looking at this
system please be aware that there are different diversities in place in
terms of what skills you use.  If you do not use bash versus kick, you
will have no bash and be as diverse as a 4.1 fighter who never got bash. 
There are less options but it will be more understandable and perhaps more
diverse.

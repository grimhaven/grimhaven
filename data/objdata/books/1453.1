Getting started

Immortals don't need to eat, drink or rent. If you need to leave, or
if you want to switch to your mortal character, just QUIT! the game
or drop link. Equipment or items on your inventory do not get saved
when you QUIT! though.

As a level 51 immortal you are somewhat limited in terms of what you
can do. Type POWER to get a list of the powers available to you,
and then HELP <power> to see what each one does.

The WIZHELP command lists the commands available to you. Get familiar
with those.

Two useful commands at this point are GOTO and WIZNET. The GOTO command
lets you move around without walking. Read HELP GOTO and GOTO HELP
(they provide different information).

The WIZNET command is a a private line for immortals to communicate
with each other. It's a good way to ask questions and clear any doubts
you may have.

You also want to get familiar with RSAVE and RLOAD as you'll be using
these soon. RSAVE is used to save your work with rooms, and RLOAD is
used to load previously saved rooms. See HELP RSAVE and HELP RLOAD.

Toggle the builder assistant on: PROMPT BUILDER. It gives you useful
information about rooms.

When you start building equipment and weapons, make sure you're
familiar with the current eq standards. If you do something that's
overpowered we'll just make you redo it.

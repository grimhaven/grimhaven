Section 3:

City of Logrus Levies a Road Tax In Response to Drow Raids  

  Though citizens of Logrus first celebrated the disappearance of the
cyclops along Redstone Road, they now cower in fear.  Logrite scouts soon
found that the cause of the cyclops' demise was a large raiding party of
drow.  Having claimed the road as their own, parties of drow have been
attacking people in the area at night.  Official representatives of the
Drow have declared that they have nothing to do with the recent raiding
parties of drow, and have denounced them as renegades.  Despite the calming
reassurances of the Drow Queen, the raids continue unabated.
  In response to this threat to Logrus' trading, the city has posted guards
during the day.  To help pay for this military presence, a toll will now be
needed to pay for passage along the Redstone Road.  Bulge the Ogre was
appointed chief toll collector.  When the Herald asked Bulge about this
honorary posting, he was on hand to reply, "What can I say? The hours are
short, the pay is good, and I get to work on my people skills!"

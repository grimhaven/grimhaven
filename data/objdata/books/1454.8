The 'P' Command
put an item in another item

P commands should be grouped with the command that loaded the item to put
the item into.

P <if> <obj vnum> <max_exist> <container vnum>

<if_flag> for 'P' commands is usually 1  (only execute it if the 
    container loaded)
<obj vnum> the vnum the object was saved under
<max_exist> see appendix at end for tips on setting
<container vnum> vnum the container is saved under

O 0 100 1 101            chest
P 1 101 2 100               black potions inside chest
P 1 101 2 100               

These command would load a chest (item 100) then put 2 black potions (item 101)
into it.  The 'P' command looks for the last item with the proper <container
vnum> and puts the stuff in it.  The second 'P' command only executes if
the one above it it (due to if_flag) and the first only executes if the command
that loaded the chest did.  This is why its important to group 'P' commands
with their respective 'O' containers.

NOTES:

CONTAINERS: Only use put with containers.

RESETTING ITEMS: You can reload items in containers (like locked chests)
each zone reset by using an if_flag of 0.  Only do this if you carefully
control the max_exist of the load so people can't just camp for items and 
design your zone so that groups would have to kill the same mobs over 
again to reach the same point.

Trigger: give
---------------------
 
ex:
give { "<number>";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

The give trigger permits the response mob to perform actions when things are
given to the creature.  <number> should be an actual number like -8 or 405.

<number>, if positive, will be treated as a vnum of an object that will
trigger the response.  Thus, if <number> = 352, then when item 352 is given,
the actions will be performed.  NOTE: The item is automatically junked by
default (without any text).  You may wish to have some sort of emote in
the action to make players aware that the item is gone.  If you need the
item, you will have to reload the item in the action script.

<number>, if negative, will be regarded as a number of talens.  Thus, if
<number> = -100, then the trigger goes off when someone gives 100 (or more)
talens to the mob.  The trigger will not go off if they give 1 talen 100
times, it has to be received in one lump sum.  NOTE: the talens are not added
to the mob's money.

At this time, it is not possible to use combination of items as triggers.

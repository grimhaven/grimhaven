NOTE regarding max_exist

The <max_exist> field is a semi confusing field, especially in light of
the fact that max_exists are declared separately on the individual mob and
obj files as well.  Please make sure you understand the following before
creating a zone file, or the Lord of Worlds may ask you to redo it.

Max-Exist in mob/obj file:
This number is the absolute, positive max for the item or creature.  It is
a world wide total and includes what has been stored in rent.  There is no
possible (outside of a bug) way for the number of creatures or items
to exceed this value.

Max-exist in the zone file (objects):
This is also an absolute "world" limit.  The item will not load if there
are more than this number of objects in The World.  Except for limited
objects, or objects you want to control loading location, it should
default to 9999.

Max-exist in the zone file (mobs only):
This represents a regional limit.  It is used to indicate the maximum
number of the given mob that will be allowed to load in the indicated
room.

Example (mobs only):
Lets say we want a dozen guards equally distributed to 4 city gates.  On
the mob file, we define max = 12.  In the zone file, we have 4 'M'
commands (one for each of the gates) loading that guard with a max defined
of 3.  This allows a maximum of 12 total ever to exist, and no more than 3
will repop in any given gate room.

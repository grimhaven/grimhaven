A Brief History of the Cult of Logrus

       The Enlightened One, Logrus, brought order to a world ruled by
chaos. When he suddenly appeared, over eight centuries ago, the area
presently occupied by Logrus was ruled by a scattering of weak,
incompetent chieftains, and his first lesson to us was to be through his
unification of the peoples of that area. The Enlightened One met with
those chieftains, and informed them that they would now kneel before him.
They reacted as might be expected of mundane, weak men. They threatened
him, but Logrus had too strong of a will to be deterred. They argued
with him, but Logrus had too great a mind to be misled. They fought him,
and so great was Logrus' power that he required no army to battle in his
stead, preferring to crush the petty lords with his own might.
       It was then that Logrus began his reign. He preached to the
people, so that they might know the Truth that had long been denied to
them. He took but a single advisor in spiritual and religious affairs,
the Bishop Seklor, and led his armies as sole general. For many years,
Logrus expanded his empire to encompass a great section of The World,
bringing the Truth unto all. However, one day, Logrus decided that he
would leave the people of The World, passing to the next life in
glorious battle with the hated Galek Brightmoon, Maker of Fools.
       Logrus, the Enlightened One, left us with a successor; nearly his
equal in power, if not in wisdom. His successor was the Arch Vampire.
Although mighty, the Arch Vampire had none of the wisdom, strength of
will, or understanding of his fellow man that made Logrus a great
leader. Due to his personal strength, the Arch Vampire remained as the
Grand master of the Cult of Logrus for over a century, with Bishop
Seklor remaining as the Logrus Master. The Cult had changed under the
reign of the Arch Vampire. The Way of Logrus was clear in its intent-
Logrus intended that through conflict, the implacable drive to improve
oneself, and accumulation of all forms of strength, that the plight of
men and women everywhere would improve. The Arch Vampire did not share
his vision. The Grand master saw the mortals as beneath his contempt, for
he did not see within them the potential that Logrus sought to unleash.
Rather, he saw them as playthings, pathetic trinkets with which the
Undead might amuse themselves. Bishop Seklor, after he was given the
dread gift of Undeadth, agreed with this, causing both the political
position of Grand master and religious position of Logrus Master to be in
agreement in the Doctrine of Madness. A war was fought, in which the
true adherents of the Way of Logrus showed the False Grand master that we
had learned the teachings of Logrus. Through conflict, we had grown
stronger, and had driven out a truly mighty adversary. The Arch Vampire,
along with the Bishop Seklor, were branded traitors to Logrus and exiled
into a Temple to the east of a city named in honor of the Enlightened
One.
       Several centuries passed. Each Grand master, rising to his station
through strength (whether that strength be personal might, political
savvy, charisma, or intellect), would direct the political policies of
the Cult, while the Logrus Master (each appointed through vote of a
council of prominent priests within the cult) would continue to remind
all of the Truth of the Way of Logrus. However, in the year 413, the
Logrus Master Aeschylus began to preach a disturbing new doctrine. The
Way of Logrus, he said, was incomplete. Logrus would never have given us
the entire Truth, he maintained, because that would run counter to
Logrus encouraging the Cult to improve oneself. Further, Aeschylus said,
the Way could only be properly interpreted by the Logrus Master, not
the Grand master of the Cult. After a series of failed negotiations,
civil war once again came to the Cult. Grand master Tokain's Loyalists
battled against the fanatical servants of Aeschylus for nearly a decade,
until Tokain slew Aeschylus in single combat in 421, ending the war.
Tokain disbanded the council of priests within the cult, executing those
whom he deemed disloyal to Logrus, and appointed a new Logrus Master.
This new Logrus Master burnt the treatises of Aeschylus, and wrote some
new doctrines far more to the liking of Tokain. Conflict, once again,
had made the Cult stronger. Since this year, the Cult has remained thus-
each Grand master rising to his or her position through strength, proving
their Superiority to those who lack the will to improve themselves, and
appointing a Logrus Master whenever the previous Logrus Master dies or
leaves the position.

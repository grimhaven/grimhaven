           <d>The Book of Endralil <1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>In the 4th year of the reign of the Prophets
I was commissioned by my dying uncle, Morianton the Seer
to continue the record of my people upon these sacred scrolls.
<y>2. <1>I being only 14 and new to such things,
knew nothing save it were given me by the hands of deity.
<y>3. <1>In my weakness I pray that this record be made strong
by their hands and carry wisdom to many future generations of Knights.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>My first memory is that of Brightmoon fields.
Their lofty scarecrows made perfect targets
for our Lances and Heavy Vindicators.
<y>2. <1>I being but a boy squire kept secret my calling
in order to more easily preserve these scriptures.
<y>3. <1>For many false prophets have arisen
to corrupt and defame the sacred words of Galek
and dilute his teachings.
<y>4. <1>I know that only through this true and honest journal
may all things be restored by a righteous seer
1 millennia after the coming of the first
for thus has it been spoken unto me.

<y>Chapter 3 <1>

<y>1. <1>Now I begin to give an account
of the occurrences hereafter among the Holy Order.
<y>2. <1>In the days where many of our Fathers and older brethren
had been slain due to their valor in combat
and idealistic tenacity, even unto the laying down of their own lives.
I witnessed a great confusion within the Order.
<y>3. <1>Insomuch that it become necessary to form a organizational structure
to preserve our beliefs,
where hitherto the sole spirit of commradery sufficed.
<y>4. <1>Many youth were dubbed Knights and Deacons in the Holy Order of Aaron,
and thus for the first time was the Knighthood split into two bodies.
<y>5. <1>This power and authority was given unto us as a preparatory state
in which to learn and prove ourselves worthy of the fullness
of the Knighthood of Melchizedek, named in honor of the first High Crusader
and stalwart Guardian under Galek himself,
to fall at the battle of Frarin Falls.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>In these early years I did my duty collecting fast offerings
and tithing funds amongst our people, for it became needful
that we rebuild our once mighty surroundings with what little we possessed.
<y>2. <1>For even our friends the Tytans could not protect us forever.
No doubt before long the forces of Logrus would be at our gates
seeking our extinction.  For they have vowed in their wrath that,
if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us,
and also the traditions of our fathers.
<y>3. <1>The Elders had formed a quorum of 12 counseling Apostles
to the Guardian of the Steps, son of Melchizedek, Enochen of Normane.
<y>4. <1>Though each of the 12 were given governing spheres
over separate aspects of the Holy Order, it was Enochen
that was Chief Commander and leader of the Knighthood.

<y>Chapter 3 <1>


<y>1. <1>Now Enochen was a Holy man, and strong in the faith of Galek.
Even were all Knights like unto him the very foundations
of those wretched ones would crumbled
to the depths from whence they spewed.
<y>2. <1>Verily he gave unto us much structure and divine truth.
<y>3. <1>Yea he did say,

<d>"For all Knights shall contribute 10% of all funds
<d>to the building up of Celestia! <1>
<d>And prove me now if our Deities <1>
<d>will not pour down blessings upon us <1>
<d>insomuch that there shall not be room enough to receive! <1>
<y>4. <1><d>Yea, I have a vision of dozens, <1>
<d>Nay, hundreds of Temples and Cathedrals <1>
<d>built in reverence to those powers <1>
<d>that have preserved us in this land. <1>
<y>5. <1><d>For have we not seen a miracle indeed! <1>
<d>Now I cry again; <1>
<d>Have we not seen this miracle! <1>
<d>The lines of trade are collapsing beneath the cultists, <1>
<d>for indeed they shall be called as such, <1>
<d>for they are they who do seek to destroy <1>
<d>the freedom of souls and bind our eyes and hands <1>
<d>with the strong cords of oppression. <1>
<y>6. <1><d>And why do they collapse? <1>
<d>Yea, it is because of their greed and lust for power <1>
<d>that warps theirs minds and clouds their souls! <1>
<d>Those strange ones of Arcadia came as visitors. <1>
<d>They have restored our trade routes, <1>
<d>yet because of such industry and commerce <1>
<d>the wanton eyes of that Vampyr grow in hate. <1>
<y>7. <1><d>Now is the time we must grow in strength my brethren. <1>
<d>I ask you not to give because you have been given, <1>
<d>no, nor because it is thy duty, <1>
<d>but because of your faith which is in our Creator! <1>
<y>8. <1><d>Support those leaders that have been chosen to govern <1>
<d>over the Knighthood <1>
<d>with all your heart, might, mind and strength. <1>
<y>9. <1><d>Sustain them in all their doings <1>
<d>and assist them in their callings. <1>
<y>10.<1> <d>Let our sacrifices unite us into one family, under one truth! <1>
<d>A nation, a people, <1>
<d>A Brotherhood!" <1>

<y>Chapter 4 <1>

<y>1. <1>There after was the structure set forth
that all those of early age be given the Knighthood of Aaron,
and responsibility corresponding to the office offices therein.
<y>2. <1>Deacons, Teachers and Crusaders were all ordained and sent forth
to preach the word of Galek to the people,
supporting the Holy Order in actions, speech and thought
and to wherever possible prevent iniquity, lying and backbiting.
<y>3. <1>The Elders of the Knighthood known as Melchizedek
were Ordained and Knighted by the sword and voice of Enochen himself,
while we assisted through our own Holy Weapons.
Elders, High Crusaders and the Apostles were all set apart
and finally the Coronation of Enochen was held.
<y>4. <1>The gathering was sparse indeed.
There were only roughly 300 Knights left after the carnage,
however, our spirits had been lifted by the Words of our Guardian.
<y>5. <1>The 12 Apostles of the Order each with their sword
upon the Shoulder of Enochen called out in accord,

<d>"Enochen of Normane,
<d>by the authority of the Knighthood of Melchizedek, <1>
<d>we the Apostles of the Holy Order <1>
<d>do unanimously knight thee the  <1>
<d>Prophet, <1>
<d>Seer <1>
<d>and Revelator <1>
<d>within our brotherhood. <1>
<d>Along with the rights and privileges <1>
<d>of the Guardian of the Holy Steps <1>
<d>as well as Governor of all Brightmoon and all her peoples!" <1>

<y>Chapter 5 <1>

<y>1. <1>And so it was in the 6th year
of the Reign of the Prophets we were sustained by the hand
of that all powerful deity who hath sent our Prophet.
<y>2. <1>I saw in the remainder of my days
a peace of sorts, perhaps a calm before the storm.
<y>3. <1>Under the direction of our Prophet,
strict codes of behavior were set forth encompassing language,
chastity and all manner of etiquette.

<y>4. <1><d>"For Behold, we shall be a clean people!
<d>An stalwart example of purity and cleanliness. <1>
<y>5. <1><d>We shall be a people true to our wives, <1>
<d>respectful of them as equals <1>
<d>and irreplaceably a part of all we stand for. <1>
<y>6. <1><d>Ye, shall be clean in speech and in grooming. <1>
<y>7. <1><d>Never let they self become obsessed <1>
<d>by any manner of worldly desire. <1>
<d>For this is not your World. <1>
<d>Ye have been sent here to overcome all of these carnal inclinations. <1>
<d>Yea, is this not what was taught by the mouth of Galek the Wise?" <1>

<y>Chapter 6 <1>

<y>1. <1>Now I thank my creator,
that I have had a life of relative peace
under the leadership of such a fine example,
our Prophet.
<y>2. <1>May we always remember his gift to us....
<y>3. <1>Now I bid thee an everlasting farewell,
save ye shall come unto the Knighthood
and employ the Edicts of Faith and Tenants of Membership 
as revealed to us by the hand of Deity.

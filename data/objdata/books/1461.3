Actions and Triggers:
--------------------

Each response block consists of one trigger, some trigger parameters and
a series of actions to perform if the trigger goes off.

say { "next guildmaster";
        tell %n "Finding your next guildmaster is part of your training.";
        tell %n "However, I can give you a hint...";
        tell %n "The one you seek is a farmboy at heart.....";
        tell %n "and he is very fond of the pipe.";
	}

In this situation, the response is triggered by the say command.  The trigger
text is "next guildmaster".  That is, if a pc says next guildmaster, our
response will trigger.  Only a handful of valid triggers have been set up.
Please see the following chapters to get a list of valid trigger commands.

The next 4 lines represents the actions of the response.  That is, when someone
says next guildmaster, then this response-mob is going to tell to them four
times.  Responses, for the most part, are any valid mud command and take the
same form as you are familiar with.  That is, smile will cause the mob
to smile, kill will make it attack, give will exchange goods, etc.

Take note of the %n.  This indicates a replacement string that may be
used in all actions.  %n will be replaced with the speaker's name.

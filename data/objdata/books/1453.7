Building: Checking your Work with Rooms

It's a good idea to go over what you've done so far to make sure you have
the right sector types in every room, correct room flags etc. An easy way
to do this is, while standing in your zone, type SHOW ROOMS. It'll list
every room in your zone with the vnum (room number), sector type, room
name and room flags. Unused rooms are not shown.

Also, make sure that doors and secret exits are saved as closed, and
locked when applicable.

When you are satisfied with your work, ask the LOW or another builder for
a walkthrough. They'll look for any mistakes you might have left behind.
After everything is set, you're done with rooms! *cheers*

Now lets get started with objects!

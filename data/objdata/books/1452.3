Long Description

The mobs long description is what is shown when the mob is in its default
position.

It needs to be a complete sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending
with a period.  The standard is to have it fit on one line, although you
can certainly go over if need be, just make sure you allow for 80 character
screenwidths.

eg.
Batopr is here typing stupid documentation.
A large whale swims about here.
A giant eagle circles overhead.

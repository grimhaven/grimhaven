General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE BLACK AGE

With trade restricted, the pockets of civilization sought outlets for their
products that had been unutilized as of yet.  The answer they came up with was
the semi-peaceful groups on the outskirts of society.  Small trading bands
began to deal with the kobolds, goblins and ogres.

At first, the traders offered finished goods in exchange for laborers and
guards.  This often proved a risky venture as more traders then one found
himself enslaved and his goods confiscated.  But a successful venture often
proved profitable as even the weakest ogre was the equal of a brawny human
male, and the stamina they had exceeded even a dwarves.  The demi-humans (orcs
and the like) became cheap sources of labor.  The demi-humans profited from
the finished products that civilization supplied them with, and they usually
had more members then they could feed Anywaysanyways, so getting rid of their excess
to the civilized lands was doubly a benefit.

It wasn't long though before the demi-humans realized a better way to take
advantage of the situation.  For while the pockets of civilization often
refused to deal with one another directly, almost all of them were trading with
the demi-humans.  Rather then being the outlets for trade, demihumans became
the middlemen keeping trade across the entire society flowing.  Not to say that
the demihumans were either fair or civilized about it.  Great profiteering
occurred on the part of the demihumans and frequently less wary tradesman were
never heard from again.

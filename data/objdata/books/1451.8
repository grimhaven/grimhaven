Take flags:

This tells the mud where the item can be worn.  It is pretty 
self-explanatory.  The following are explanations of some of the flag 
options other than simple ones like on body.

TAKE:  This is important to have set.  Only objects set TAKE may be picked up.

THROW: Mostly for weapons.  Lets the weapon be thrown (using the ranged weapon
code).  Any weapon less then about 800 units in volume should be throw-able.
Others you may set as appropriate.

HOLD:  This refers to hands and hold-able.  Weapons need to be hold as do 
shields.

NOTES:

ONLY ONE SLOT:  DO NOT make items wearable in more then 1 slot.  ie, don't
have something wearable on the hands and the feet, as the code gets
confused. 

USE TRADITIONAL SLOTS:  Avoid making items worn in non-traditional slots. 
Cloaks are for the back, not the neck.  Shields are for hold, not the arm. 
etc. 

SET DAGGERS THROW-ABLE:  Make sure all weapons under 800 volume are 
throw-able unless there is a legitimate reason.

Topic: checkzone
--------------------

Ex:
<block> { "<args>";
	...responses...;
	checkzone <room>;
	...responses...;
	}

<room> = Room inside zone that mobile should be in.

  This will check the mobiles current inRoom zone and verify that
it matches up with the zone <room> is in.  If not then parsing is
stopped.

  'checknotzone' checks the mobiles current inRoom zone and verifies
that it does not match with the zone <room> is in.  If it does match,
parsing is stopped.

Notes:
  <room> == Factual room, not zone number.  If you see this in
  show zones:
    0 Void                                     25m   17m      0-0
    1 Immortal Zone                              25m   17m      1-99
    2 Grimhaven Roads                           5m    3m    100-249

    5 King's Palace                            25m   17m    350-399

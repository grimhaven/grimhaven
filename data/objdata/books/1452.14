Money Constant

Not all mobs should carry gold, most animals should not.  The value set here
is dependant on the mob's level and also controls potion and component loads.

Adjust the level down substantially if the mob has equipment, treasure or
other booty.

NOTES:

ANIMALS:  You should not give an animal money, however you can load with 
other treasures and sell-able equipment.

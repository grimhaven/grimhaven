Advanced Action: personalize
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       personalize <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

Personalize is an action that will load the item given by <number> as a vnum,
personalize it to be the person who did the trigger's items, and give it to
the person.

At the end of the personalize action, the item will be in the performer's
inventory, so you do NOT need to do a separate give.  Personalize also loads
so do NOT do a separate load.

There is text associated with personalizing automatically done.  You do not
need separate echos for loading, stringing and giving.

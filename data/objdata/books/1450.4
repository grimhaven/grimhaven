Sector Types

This represents the type of terrain the "room" is.  It affects movement cost,
thickness (scan, ranged weapons), and fullness costs (hunger, thirst, drunk).
Additionally, the movement-code looks closely at sector type to determine
"how" people are moving (swimming, walking, climbing, flying, falling).

Ultimately, this will also relate to weather/climate.

If you have questions about this, or want a NEW type of terrain, talk to
the LOW.  You may want to brush up on your knowledge on swimming
and gravity (as they relate to the mud) before setting some of these
sector types. 

NOTES: 

INDOOR SECTOR TYPES AND ROOM FLAGS: setting a sector as a building/cave
does NOT imply that it is indoors.  Remember to set this room flag or you
will have it raining inside your cave. 

AIR AND WATER ROOMS:  Be sparing and thoughtful in your use of  gravity
type and water rooms in places where newbies will be.  It is ok to use
but be aware, drops will mean deaths and complaints about deathtraps. Water
rooms can trap newbies who are unlikely to have any swimming skills.

VERTICAL ROOMS: Only set verticals on rooms with a down exit, or else people
won't be really climbing, will they?

TELEPORTS: You can set up a TELEPORT room as well.  See HELP EDIT for how
to do this, and it might be wise to talk to an experienced builder before
you do this.  Teleport rooms CAN NOT be set up in the REDITer.

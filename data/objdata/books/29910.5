           <d>The Book of Ammondron <1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>I am the son of Chemish, who was the son of Golgondren,
who was the son of Almaran, who lived in the Day of Ethren the Seer.
<y>2. <1>It came to pass in the year of the Prophets 250,
I Ammondron, having been charged by the clergy to reassemble
this record of the Holy Order and deliver it up unto them
to be placed amidst the archives of the Cathedral, didst set to the task of
abridging the records of our Fathers.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>These last months our attendances had been very low.
<y>2. <1>Ever since the knowledge of Galeks Faerie background
and brotherhood with Logrus was discovered from within the texts
of the High Ones, we have been struggling for a purpose.  
<y>3. <1>Pawns in a game.....Alas...Pawns in a game, so they say.
I don't see how this changes things.  Are we not still a Brotherhood?
Do we not still have the Truth? 
<y>4. <1>Alas with no Prophet, no guidance,
tis my fear there is no need for our Knights.
<y>5. <1>The fall of Ethren rocked the foundation of our retreating Knighthood,
for where was his successor? 
<y>6. <1>Nor could the quorum receive inspiration as to who would be chosen next.
They sat for months in the Cathedral praying and imploring
the Great Creator to reveal the next Prophet,
however, the heavens remained silent.
<y>7. <1>It was decided that the Quorum would disband and go in search of a sign.
Each left their occupations, homes and families
forsaking all but their mission and departing
into The World in search of an answer.
<y>8. <1>Not a one returned.
<y>9. <1>The Knighthood was in a crisis.
Without Apostles or a Prophet we were compelled to separate the Orders
religious clergy from the professional government.

<y>Chapter 3 <1>

<y>1. <1>The Constitution was drawn up amidst a council of remaining Elders.
The first draft was done in three months.
<y>2. <1>Detailing the checks of the Melchizedek Knighthood
over that of the Aaronic, which now represented the layman masses,
and vice versa.  
<y>3. <1>It affirmed the Tenants of Faith and Edicts of Membership,
yet substituted a clause for lack of Prophetic guidance.
<y>4. <1>The responsibility in that case was given to a Proctor
who was to appoint assistants to help in his administration.
<y>5. <1>The Quorum of the 12, then made up the governing council
of chief-judges for the land,
governed the people under the direction of the Proctor
and his administration for many years.
<y>6. <1>While the 2 spheres of Knighthood sought to represent
the desires of the people economicly as well as militarily.
<y>7. <1>And therein the brotherhood was governed by the Law
administered unto them by their fathers which was just and true,
and delivered by the hand of the Deities themselves.
<y>8. <1>Bishops and Priests were also set apart and consecrated
by the Elders to care for the religious needs of the people,
as well as plead to the Deities to free us from this dark period.

<y>Chapter 4 <1>


<y>1. <1>The stress between the Holy Order of Knights and the Cultists
lessened due to the Leadership crisis of the day,
additionally abated by that new knowledge that has shaken
the foundations of both religions.
<y>2. <1>There were occasional flares of fervor, however,
our first Proctor Lord Michan was a keen man
and did quell many rebellions and uprisings
with his stratagem and bureaucracy.
<y>3. <1>Yea, and Michan did set forth spies round about,
that he might know when the Cultist were to come upon them and from where.
<y>4. <1>Therein he came to know the intentions of the Logrites,
that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, 
or subject them and bring them to bondage
that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land.
<y>5. <1>And he also knowing that it was the only desire
of the Knighthood of the Holy Order to preserve their lands,
and their liberty, and their faith.
<y>6. <1>Therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them even by
stratagem, hence, he found by his spies which actions the cultists would take.
<y>7. <1>Yea and he did armor, equip and train his people mightily,
and caused that they might become and industrious people
full of hard work and honest labor.
Yea and Brightmoon began to flourish once again.

<y>Chapter 5 <1>

<y>1. <1>Our missionaries became ambassadors and beacons to many races;
Ever willing to spread the message of Galek the Wise
and wherever they went the protection of the Guardian of the Steps followed.
<y>2. <1>And there was peace in the land for many years.

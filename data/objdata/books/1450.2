 Description

The description is the long textual portion of a room.  It can be toggled
on and off with the brief command.  The editor does NOT break the lines,
so remember to hit return before you enter your 81st character or you will get text that looks like this :)
Each new sentence starts with a double space. After you have finished
editing your description, you can use the autoformat option with the EDIT
(see HELP EDIT) command to properly adjust your text.

Room descriptions should be all one paragraph.  The more you write, the more
likely it is people will turn on brief mode.  The idea here is to be concise
but to also give people the mood and feel of the place they are in.  Try 
to bring a story for the zone to life in your descriptions. 

THINGS TO WATCH FOR:

MENTION WINDOWS AND DOORS: Windows (object types) and all doors should be
explicitly mentioned in the description.  Windows because they aren't
displayed as objects, and doors because a closed door will not appear
under the exits command.  Do avoid mentioning things like "a locked door"
"a closed gate" as the actual position the door or gate is in will change
while the room-text can not.

GIVE CLUES TO SECRET ROOMS: If you are designing secrets to be found by a
pc, it is likely that you will have to put your first clue in the room
description so make sure that rooms that should have clues, have
appropriate clues. 

DO NOT MENTION NON-PERMANENT ITEMS AND CREATURES: Items and creatures in
the room should NOT be mentioned.  The creature should be a mob, and the
item would be an object each having appropriate descriptions of their own. 
If you have something very trivial (like moss, lichen, gravel, etc) you
can mention it in the description (rather than making a stupid obj for it)
BUT you should make sure you set up an extra description (see below) for
it so that if they look at something they see in the description it won't
say "you don't see that here". 

NON-DIRECTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS: Also, it is BAD to assume that characters
have entered from a given direction. Examples of this would be: "You come
through a door and a cavern stretches away before you."  What if they are
coming back?  Then you would want it to say "The cavern ends, but a simple
door presents itself as a path onward." Since you can't have two
descriptions, you must generalize your text. "This is the southern end of
a large cavern that stretches northward out of sight.  There is a simple
door in the south wall."  Now it doesn't matter if they are coming in or
exiting, the description is still accurate. 

AVOID USING "YOU": It's a crutch for describing rooms, the players know they
are there so don't tell them they are. Avoid talking to the player in the
room description. An example would be "You stand in a large forest." which
can be written as "A large forest stretches to all directions.".

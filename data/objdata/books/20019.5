TREASURE HUNT:  Players will be given a riddle that will lead to a treasure
map. The treasure map will depict an area on the mud where the treasure
chest is located. There will be a riddle upon the treasure chest that will
lead to the key needed to open it.  The first team to successfully open the
treasure chest gets the contents.  Approved contestants and groups will 
meet at the appointed time in the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the 
area above Grimhaven Center Square unless otherwise posted to the 
Tournament/Quest board.

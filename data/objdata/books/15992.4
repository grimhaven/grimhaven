Communiqué via Invocation

As we have learned, Marukalia can be persuaded to release magical energies
through the proper bequest.  Invocation of thaumaturgic magic using material
enticement alone is not enough for the book, however [1].  A charm also requires
some persuasion via language.  The words could even be gibberish, however only
certain words will invoke the Book.  It seems most likely that these words
somehow remind Marukalia of some time past, and compel it toward action [2].

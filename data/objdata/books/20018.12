GRIMHAVEN HIDE AND SEEK:  It's very simple: A god will hide in Grimhaven,
the players try to find him :).  When you find him, you must follow him. 
The god may move.  However if you spot him, you may tell him to freeze and
give him the rough location so he knows that you did spot him.  He must
then freeze for 30 seconds to let you catch him.  However, after that he
may move and try to avoid you.  NOTE: The sewers will not be included,
however the theater, church, palace, mage academy, thief hideout etc. are
valid areas.  No rangers may apply.  If you are a ranger, make a newbie or
bring another one of your characters. Mages and winners will also be
checked for track spell which will be considered a form of cheating. 
Contestants are to meet in the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the area
above Grimhaven Center Square unless otherwise posted on the
Tournament/Quest Board.  There will be prizes to the first 3 PC's to find
the hider.

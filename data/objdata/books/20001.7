Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your archery
accuracy skills.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant character
to participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you will meet
with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details and
assign you this color and this contestant character. 

Upon logging your color-coded character in, the tournament organizer will
give you a special tournament bow and a certain number of arrows.  This
bow has been specially designed to kill special "prey" characters in
one hit.  There will also be innocent characters to add a little spice to
the challenge.  Your mission if you choose to accept it will be to spare
the innocent and kill all of the prey characters while sprinting through a
special kill zone. 

The event will take place in one of the tournament pits.  The pit will be
well lit and contain no surprises.  The pit will be 10 rooms long.  You
will start at the south wall and finish on the north wall. 

Each step you take north may present one or more "prey" for you to shoot. 
They may be in any direction.  The pray will be mixed in with "innocents"
to confuse your scan.  You are to shoot all prey and reach the north wall
where the tournament organizer will be waiting.  The winner will be the
contestant who kills all the prey in the fastest time.

Killing innocents and missing the prey will not directly penalize your
time.  However, since you will have a limited number of arrows, bad
shooting will waste your time and make you run to the tournament 
organizer to get more arrows when you run out. 

May the fastest most accurate Archer win.

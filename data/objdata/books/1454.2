At the top of the zonefile are some very basic pieces of information.
Start by writing the following three lines:

#<zone number>
<builder - zone title>~
<last room> <lifespan> <reset mode> <enabled>

The <zone number> is the first room in your zone.
So if your zone has rooms 10100 to 10399, your zone number is 10100

<zone title> is whatever you want it to be.  Additionally, please put your
immortal's character name so we know who did the zone later on.

<Last room> is the highest assigned room in the zone regardless of
whether you have used it or not.

<Lifespan> of the zone is the number of ticks between calls to reset_zone.
I recommend at least 20 and no more than 60.  between 30-40 is best.

<Reset mode> is a number between 0 and 2.
0:  never reset the zone
1:  reset zone only if zone is deserted  (no players in area)
2:  RECOMMENDED:  reset zone as soon as lifetime (time from last reset) exceed
       lifespan.  Does not care if people are in it or not.

<enabled> indicates whether the zone is actually "in the game".  Builders should
always set this value to 0 until the LOW activates the zone.

Example:
#100
Batopr - Super Test Zone~
10099 27 2

NOTES:

USE RIGHT ZONE NUMBER:  This is not the same number as in "show zone".  
Room numbers will be the same numbers that are in your world files.

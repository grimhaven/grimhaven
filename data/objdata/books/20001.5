Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your survival
skills.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant character to
participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you will meet
with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details and
assign you this color and this contestant character. 

At the same time, gods or other contestants will log in hunter characters. 
These hunters will be given special backstab weapons.  This backstabber is
designed to kill you in three hits.  Your mission if you choose to accept
it will be to avoid being killed by the hunters for as long as you can. 

The event will take place in color-coded square tournament pits.  They are
well lit and contain no surprises.  These pits range in size from 25 rooms
to 100 rooms.  

The hunter characters will enter the pit after you and from different
directions.  They may be gods they may be other contestants.  In either
case, they will try to hunt you.  The hunters will have carry the
tournament backstabber which will kill you in three rounds.  You will be
unarmed.  You should be prepared to flee often and fast.  They shall show
no mercy. 

Once you die, the last hunter will take a "head" out of your corpse and
deliver it to the tournament organizer.  This will mark the end of the
event.  The winner of a heat will be the contestant who avoids the hunters
for the longest time.  The event will also have a timer and end after 15 
minutes in which case the winner will be the prey who was hit the least.  
Ties will have a run-off heat.

This event will be run in heats.  You will be grouped randomly in groups 
of four (4).  The winners of these groups will then compete against each 
other to determine the event winner and runner-up.  May the best survivor  
win.

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE ARRIVAL OF GALEK

Galek arrived into The World near the time that the Cult was beginning to
take hold.  What Logrus left unsaid in his teachings was just how bad life
was for the common man under the Cult's thumb.  Those not a part of the
Cult could be persecuted by any member of the hierarchy with impunity,
but joining was equivalent to accepting an oppressive yoke of what was
due to your leader.  This was the message of Galek and it was well
received in certain areas.

Galek preached personal responsibility and the inherent worth of the
individual.  While he admitted many problems were beyond the means of one
person to overcome, subjugating another to your will was unacceptable.
Cooperation in the face of adversity was the greatest virtue.  And his chief
tenant was respect for another's wishes, that they might respect yours.  The
missionaries of Galek spread this word far and wide, and wherever the
missionaries went, the Guardians of the Steps, a force of trained paladins
dedicated to Galek, were there to defend them.

As Logrus's word appealed to the ego of a leader strong enough to have
many followers, Galek's philosophies swayed the passions of the vast
multitudes that would be forced to the bottom of Logrus's hierarchy.

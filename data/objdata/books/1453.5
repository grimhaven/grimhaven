Building: Room Name

All the words in room names should have the first letter capitalized, except
for words like "the", "and", "of" and other short prepositionals.

To edit the room name, while standing on it type EDIT NAME <name>

Move on to the next room and do the same. That's it! Remember to RSAVE to
save your progress!

Action: toroom
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       toroom <string>;
       <other actions>;
     }

The toroom action is an advanced emote or echo command.  It will send <string>
to every person in the room (except the trigger mob).  It is recommended that
toroom make no reference to the person doing the action (use tovict, tonotvict
instead).

The beauty of toroom is that it allows you to use replacement characters
that will be filled in when it is actually performed based on who did the
trigger and with what.

Replacement strings:
$n  = the trigger-mobs name
$e  = "he", "she" or "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$m  = "him", "her", "it" based on sex of trigger-mob
$s  = "his", "hers", "its" based on sex of trigger-mob

$o  = the first word in the name of the trigger-object (for give)
$p  = the full name of the trigger-object

Example:
toroom $n tosses a small key into the air and catches it behind $s back.
becomes
A lazy thief tosses a small key into the air and catches it behind his back.

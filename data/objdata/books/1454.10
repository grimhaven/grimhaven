The 'G' command

This command is used to give an object to a mob.  As such it is used for 
loading almost all key loads as well as loading things into a mobs 
inventory.  You should not use this command to load armor or worn stuff 
unless you have a reason.

The 'G' command gives an item to the last mob referenced

G <if_flag> <obj vnum> <max_exist>

<if_flag> is typically 1   (only if the mob it should be given to exists)
<obj vnum> is vnum obj is saved as
<max_exist> see note on end for tips on setting

M 0 100 4 102        orc
G 1 101 1               brown key
G 1 102 10              bag of garbage

These commands would load an orc and then give him a bag of garbage.  It only
tries the 'G' if the orc loaded and only if 9 or fewer bags of garbage exist.
Note that the comment for the item to be given should be indented slightly from
the comment of the mob to put it on.  

NOTE:

KEYS: Make sure if you are giving a key to a mob that the key command is
the first conditional command to execute.  ie, if we did orc->garbage->key
the key would not load if the garbage didn't.

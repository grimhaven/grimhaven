How is <h> different from every other MUD?
------------------------------------------------

In the MUDs heyday, there were hundreds of MUDs to choose from as the
popularity of text-based multi-user roleplaying games exploded around
the world.  Countless of new MUDs were introduced.  Unfortunately, most
of these muds were stock MUDs.  A stock MUD is a MUD which was developed
by a group of coders who released the source code for others to use to
set up their own MUD.  Many MUDs never deviated from this stock code,
so the only differences between these MUDs were in who played the MUD
and who administered it.  The same old worlds, different people.

<h> was originally developed from the SillyMUD stock code (opened June
1992) making <h> a member of the DIKU (essentially a combat-oriented MUD)
family of muds.  However, unlike many stock muds, <h> made a commitment
to continued development.  In the many years of its life, the MUD has been
rewritten three times, once to add vastly more functionality, once to upgrade
from C to C++, and once again to add even more functionality.  This attention
to innovation can be seen in the differences between <h> and other MUDs.

At the same time, the libraries of mobs, objects and rooms were completely 
replaced to make use of the advanced features that had been incorporated,
as well as to take advantage of more advanced database technology, moving
away from flat text files.

While we have maintained the "look-and-feel" of the standard DIKU mud, the 
guts of the mud are a completely different beast.


Why should I play <h> instead of one of the graphical MMORPGs?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As technology advanced, so did the online multi-user roleplaying games.
MUDs gave way to graphical environments that mimicked all the things
people loved about MUDs, but with pretty pictures.  This became a very
successful endeavor, but it comes with a price for players.  

First of all, the massively multi-player online roleplaying games cost money.
Not only do the games cost a monthly fee, but they require high-power computing 
to process the graphics and a high-bandwidth connection to the internet.
SneezyMUD can run on nearly any old computer and can still be played from
low-bandwidth connections.

Secondly, as the MMORPGs quickly proved to be great money-makers, those
who published the games became strictly companies in it for the profit.
Where before, a game was run with community involvement and players could
often volunteer their time to help their game and become active in its
development, now those who play are simply consumers with no say in their
world.  Here on SneezyMUD, the gods are players and players have a voice
and an opportunity to help shape their world.

Thirdly, MMORPGs fall prey to the famous internet formula of anonymity + a big
audience = jerks.  Tens of thousands of faceless names occupy the servers of
an MMORPG, and "griefing" and jacka**ery are impossible to avoid.   Here at
SneezyMUD, we are a warm and welcoming community made up of people who have
gotten to know one another and have formed lifelong friendships.  We welcome
with open arms new members of our community and aim to treat everyone as
we would like to be treated.   Many of our players feel that the community
is more like a family than a group of gamers.   Our administrators feel
strongly about keeping griefing out of the game to create a welcoming and
friendly atmosphere.

We invite you to experience SneezyMUD, a completely free game you can play
from almost anywhere in the world on nearly any computer.  Come see how you
can affect the world and form friendships with your fellow players.

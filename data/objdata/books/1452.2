Short Description

The short description of the mob is the shortest display of text that will
be used to indicate the monster.  The short description is used in places like
"you hit (short description)"  "(short) slithers east."

Don't confuse this with the name field.  Name is used to refer to the mob,
short is used to display it.  eg
> hit (name)    <-- looks for a match in the name field
You hit (short) hard.  <-- displays short to tell player what was hit

Make sure the short description starts with a lower case letter.  The code
knows when to capitalize appropriately. The only words that should 
be capitalized are proper names and maybe some titles.  Also, don't put
periods at the end of the short description.

good shorts:
Batopr, Lord of Worlds
a cityguard
the raccoon of doom

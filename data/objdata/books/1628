General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE DIRECTIVES OF EMPEROR SPIRT

And it came to pass that each of the 10 directives was carried out.  The
human enclaves began communication and trade one with each other.  At the same
time, the Four Races remained as isolated holdings shielded from contact with
each other by their mistrust and ancient hatreds.  As the years passed,
knowledge that one human group had obtained from the Four Races was passed
throughout humanity.  Innovations that one person devised were transmitted
around and advancement jumped by incredible amounts.  In the 39 years of
Spirt's rule, the gap between human knowledge and that of the Four Races was
cut by 3/4ths.

The son of Spirt, his daughter (Spirt's granddaughter) and her son would
follow as Emperor's themselves before the first human dynasty was to collapse
and the Emperorship of humanity left vacant.  But in that short time, humans
rose from a distant, ignorant, backwater race into a civilized society.

The power of civilization had not been lost on the Four Races.  Meager attempts
were made to duplicate it, but most met with failure or wound up as pale
shadows of what humanity had achieved.  Ultimately, the Four Races were forced
to plead to be included in the civilization humanity had achieved.  Humanity
was of course happy to oblige, for each addition brought increased trade
opportunities, but brought about new inroads into the faeriekin knowledge that
remained secret.  And as time went by, it ceased to be Four Races and humanity,
but instead became the civilized peoples and the civilized lands.

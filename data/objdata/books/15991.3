And lo, Leroy and his disciples traveled to the base of the Parnathian Mountains
by a river and lay upon the ground.
And said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto
us, A little while, and we shall eat a feast likening that unto heroes?
Now Leroy knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye
wish it that we break wafers, and drink and sup by this river?
And the disciples replied, Lord that soundeth like an idea most excellent.
Whereupon Leroy produced two large wafers of unleavened bread, and did say, Eat
and drink of the water of yon river.
But one disciple mumbled amongst the crowd, saying, We are tired from the
journey, and wish a feast of heroes to fill us.
Leroy answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, seek not to fill your bellies,
but seeketh instead to fill your soul with the glory of the Lord.
And the disciples did grumble and lament.

Chapter III : Applying the Coils.

	Just as the python must stealth-fully sneak up on its victim, wrap
itself around and then constrict, we the Order must present ourselves to
those we are in conflict with and convince them that we can assist them
before we can truly profit. If the Order is unable to win the trust
of our opponents and entwine ourselves around them, then we are unable to
bring the full power of the Coils to bear. Be not afraid to perform
actions, that will earn the trust of our enemies, but remember the tenants
of the Coils are within your hands; leave them free and they will fall,
twist them to the extremes and they will break. Achieve balance within
yourself and you will control your powers, and eventually gain much more.

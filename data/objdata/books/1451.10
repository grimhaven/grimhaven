Cost/value

This is the item's worth.  The code references this to determine how much
it can be bought or sold for, how much it costs to repair or sharpen.  It 
should both show what the pc will get for it and also reflect the value 
the builder and the mud puts on the object so you need to balance these 
figures very carefully.

The objects rent cost is 0.5 * cost per day.  Currently this figure shows 
up but is not used by code.

There is no fixed formula for setting an items cost except for some item
types.  Moreover since all items have different characteristics, values
maybe slightly subjective.  However, there are the guidelines set by
existing objects in The World and you should try to fit your items into
The World. 

NOTES:

GIVE ALL ITEMS A VALUE:  Shops will not buy items whose value is <= 1
coin. Receptionists will not let items whose value is < 0 be rented.  You
should use the NO_RENT flag to set such items up if you are doing this
intentionally. 

CHECK VALUES:  Check your values against other objects in The World

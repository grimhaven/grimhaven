Advanced Action: untoggle
---------------------
 
ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       untoggle <number>; 
       <other actions>;
     }

untoggle will unset quest-toggle <number> on the performer.  Quest-toggles are
hard coded so talk with a coder before using this command.

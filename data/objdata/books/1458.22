Immortality on <h>
------------------------

You may notice a couple of different types of "immortals" on the who list.

The two most common categories are "demigod" and "creator".  The demigod
is an area designer or "builder" and is part of the team that helps create
new zones for our players to explore.  The builders are headed up by the
Lord of Worlds (LOW).   Builders are not "gods" and are not to deal in
mortal affairs and do not speak with the authority of the gods (creators).

The "creator" is a member of the MUD Admin, a committee of contributors
that volunteer their services for the MUD and continue development for the
MUD.  Creators will include the LOW, coders, quest god, system administrator,
and webmaster.   All these gods should be able to assist you should you
require help.

To see what gods are available, type "who -gl".

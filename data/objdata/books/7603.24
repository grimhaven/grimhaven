Immortality on <h>
------------------------

Upon reaching level 50 in all of your respective classes, you can petition
to become a member of the <h> builders and immortals if you wish to
help contribute to the MUD.  Anyone who reaches level 50 in all classes
will be given the choice to stay a mortal, or to become a level 51 builder.

Level 51 builders can contribute in a number of ways.  Those that like to
build will be given a zone and be allowed to construct an area.  Those who
prefer to do roleplaying can run major quests for the players, or can 
design the coded quests.  Players who are especially knowledgeable in a
specific class may be asked to help provide input to the coding team.

Promotion past Level 51 is dependent upon an individuals contribution to
the MUD.  At this point, the immortal can advance his/her level by 
continuing to build or by continuing to play the MUD and helping things run
smoothly.

Builders are denoted as [Area Design] in a 'who -bl' listing. These people
are *NOT* gods, but immortals.  They are not to deal in mortal affairs and
do not speak with the authority of the gods.  It is in your best interest
that you bring your problem to a true god who can actually help you.

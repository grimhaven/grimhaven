Building: Mobiles

There is no way to create a mobile from scratch, so what you'll have to
load one that is similar to what you want and modify it. Currently there
is only one way to do so, with the MEDIT editor.

First, use SHOW MOB <mob> to get a list of mobiles, where <mob> is the
mobile's name you're looking for. For example:
	show mob cityguard
	show mob drunk-man

Now, load a mob that is similar to what you want using LOAD MOB <mob>,
where <mob> can be either the mobile's name or vnum. Next and finally,
start modifying the mobile. Use MED MODIFY <mob> to get into the mobile
editor screen and go through the menus to adjust your mob to you liking.

Don't forget to save your work, when out of the editor screen use MED
SAVE <mob> <vnum>, where <mob> is your mobile's name and <vnum> is the
number to save it under. Remember it should be within your zone number
range.

To see a list of saved mobiles, use MED LIST.

TIPS

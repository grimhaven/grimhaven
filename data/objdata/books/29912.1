Chapter I : The Way of the Serpent.

One might see the snake as a weak animal, lacking limbs and having no
control of his surrounding. The amazing and dazzling ability of the snake
to sneak into places where the biggest animals can't get to, is always over
looked by the viewers. With his limb-less body the snake always coils and
whirls around slowly to reach its unaware target until it snaps its
venomous jaws at it and takes total control over it. The snake uses his
limb-less coils in order to achieve this beautiful sequence to deal with his
daily problems in life. There is a large diversity of snakes, each one has
its own unique ability. One should learn from this beautifully balanced
animal, because not all snakes use venom and backstab to deal with their
problems. A lot of those beautiful animals use their strength to crush
their preys between their powerful coils. Order of the Serpent is the
balanced coils of a snake and functions with the same harmony in order to
achieve the purpose intended by the individuals.

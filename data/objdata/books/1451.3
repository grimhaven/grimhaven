Item type

Item type determines what kind of an object it is.  It also changes what the
4-values (see chapter 11) will mean.  Pick the one that best applies from the 
OEDIT item type menu.

Note that some item types are handled dynamically by the mud: a plant, at
young ages, will be just a "mound of dirt".

Some of these item types are obsolete, please ask if you use anything out
of the ordinary.

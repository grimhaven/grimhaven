SECRET DOORS:

Secret doors have their place in a FRP environment, however, don't get
carried away with these.  The ONLY way to detect these at present is via
the thief SEARCH command.  Secret doors are an option in both the REDIT
editor and the edit command.

If you have a secret door, you MUST do the following if you want PC's to have
any chance at all of finding your door.

Something in the room description should be eyecatching or out of the
ordinary.  "The walls are made of stucco."

An extra description must be set up that reveals something a LOT out of the
ordinary, or a series of descriptions must be set up.

walls stucco:  "Millions of tiny bumps dot the wall.  The bumps on one part
   of the wall seem to have been rubbed smooth."
bumps smooth part: "The stucco here has been rubbed smooth.  Probably because
   there is a button concealed nearby."
button: "Pushing the button would OPEN THE STUCCO wall."
---> the secret doors name would then be "stucco".

You MUST have at bare minimum ONE extra description for each secret door.
Also remember the "other" side of the door will be secret too, so you may
want to say something in the room description on the far-side too like:
"The secret passage through the stucco wall you passed through lies somewhere
around here.  Now where did it go?"

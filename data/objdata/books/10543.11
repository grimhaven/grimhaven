Section 11

Editor's Note

  I would just like to take this time to welcome everyone to <h> 5.0.
If you are new to this mud then you are in for a very complex yet fun mud
filled with interesting people, dedicated coders, and some fun zones (If
you want a more in-depth description check one of many ads on the net).  If
you are returning to the mud, WELCOME BACK.  Hopefully we have added enough
new things to this mud to give you the feeling of something new and better.
If you were a Beta Tester (yes I know), this version has been a long time
coming!  But hopefully you will find that the wait was worth it.  A lot of
changes have occurred over the beta period, and since we are a rapidly
developing mud, expect a lot more changes over the next few years.
Hopefully though, these changes will help improve game-play and not hinder
it, and above all will not result in a player-wipe.  If you like the mud, 
please tell your friends about it.  If you find a new addition of the mud
that is really interesting- kindly tell the god responsible for it, for
they often do not hear compliments for their work.  Most importantly… HAVE
FUN!

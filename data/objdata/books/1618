General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE GNOMES

As elves and dwarves spread across The World, fragmenting their society into
individual branches in the process, the gnomes watched.  Their own society grew
at a rapid pace, as it was a group effort to advance.  While not as diverse as
the other two races, their skills and commitment to their community goals made
them a force to be reckoned with.
 
The Faeries had instilled in the gnomes a strong sense of preservation for the
elves.  Too, they had given them a sense of wisdom, and it was this that had
caused the initial gnomes to realize that not only was it the elves who were
the Faerie's children, but also the dwarves as well as themselves.  Having been
directed to preserve the Faerie kin, they had set about how best to accomplish
this, using their own unique definitions.
 
The gnome leaders had concluded that the elf-dwarf conflict had to be
terminated in order for either of those races to progress.  They also perceived
that the reason the conflict had gone on for so long was that both sides had
an adequate feeling of safety from natural threats, thus leisure time was spent
in waging war.  Hence they set out to create a few more natural threats that
would require both races to worry about.

General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE SLAVE REVOLTS AT FRARIN FALLS

To the Galekians, the most distressing practice the Cult practiced was the
use of slave labor.  It was completely antithetical to teachings dedicated to
the worth of every individual.  On the Cult side, the only use for a failed
follower or a defeated enemy was as a slave.  And so, when a minor slave
uprising occurred near the falls at Frarin, the stage was set for conflict.

For years, the Cult had used vast numbers of Tytan laborers (cyclops,
trolls, minotaurs, etc) to do the heavy work required to mine the area for
its deposits of argentium and athanor.  It was strenuous labor, the lifespan
of even the most hardy of Tytan was measured in years, while few humans
condemned here survived to see another birthday.  Tytan's had served here
since the earliest days of the Cult when they had been enslaved en masse for
Logrus's personal use when they proved unusable as a demihuman threat.

When an escapee made it to the paladin hold at Rursak and requested aid,
claiming a revolt was in progress, the Galekians had all the excuse they
needed.  Fourteen legions marched on the measly garrison maintained at
Frarin.  As the paladins approached the defenders, they realized no revolt
was occurring, but as the Tytans saw the paladins, their spirits jumped and
a revolt was soon brought about.  Seizing this opportunity, the paladins
rode to the aid of the Tytans and succeeded in the rescue.  Fully fifteen
thousand Tytans were freed that day, and the debt they feel they owe the
Galekians continues to this day.  "Remember Frarin" being words no Tytan
can ignore.

Delete an exit:

Fairly self explanatory.  It will eliminate an exit from a room and 
delete any doors in that direction.  WARNING: SEE NOTE BELOW ON FIXING 
ROOM FLAGS and EXITS IN BOTH ROOMS.

NOTES:	

FIXING ROOM FLAGS/RETURN EXITS:  Deleting an exit does NOT delete the
return exit or the room flags in the target room.  This mean if you make
and inadvertent exit/door to a room or want to delete an exit between
rooms, you must do *more* than delete the exit to fix the error.  You must
fix/delete both sides of an exit and fix room flags in both rooms.

ONE-WAY EXITS AND DOORS:  One directional exits can be accomplished by
creating an exit to and from rooms A and B, then deleting the exit on the
bad side, thus leaving only the ONE-WAY exit you wanted. But why you'd want
to do that I don't know. :)

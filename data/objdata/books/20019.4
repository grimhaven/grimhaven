ITEM HUNT:   Players will be given a large list of items which they must
make every effort to acquire. Almost anything goes in this event.  Players may 
get items off their other characters, buy the items, kill mobs for the items,
and even buy them off other PC's :).  The only methods that will *NOT* be
tolerated are player killing and stealing from PC's (*See Note*).  These 
actions will be dealt with severely.  The players must acquire as many items as 
they can within the given time limit (designated by a god) and bring them 
safely to a specified location (also designated by a god).  Items will have 
point values, the team that has collected items for the highest combined point 
value wins.  Approved contestants and groups will meet at the appointed 
time in the Mud-Wide Contestant's lounge in the area above Grimhaven 
Center Square unless otherwise posted on the Tournament/Quest board.

* Note * : Players may log these other PC's in *ONLY* to transfer items
and/or money. They must then immediately log off.

The 'D' Command:

D command handles door resetting.  Please put all door commands at the top
of your zonefile right after the header.  Additionally, for any given door,
there must be 2 *TWO* D commands (one command for each 'side' of the
door). 

D <if_flag> <room> <direction> <lock_arg>

<if_flag> is generally always 0 for doors.
<room> is the vnum of the room the door is in.
<direction> is the direction the door leaves in.  The number IS DIFFERENT from
  the REDITor.   (0 = N, 1 = E, 2 = S, 3 = W, 4 = U, 5 = D, 6 = NE,
   7 = NW, 8 = SE, 9 = SW)
<lock_arg> should be either 1 or 2:
  1: close the door
  2: close the door and lock it

Example:

D 0 100 0 2              Queen's Room
D 0 110 2 2

Assuming there was a door north from room 100 into room 110, these two commands
would close both sides of the door and lock them.  Note that you should just
comment/explain the pair of door commands once.

NOTES:

CONNECTION WITH WORLD FILE:  Every door in your zone (both sides) needs 
to have a command in the zone file to tell the mud its condition.  If 
they do not match the exit will be unusable.

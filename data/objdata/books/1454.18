The 'Y' command
Load a set of gear.  Bulk loader.

This command is useful for quickly loading a complete set of a certain armor
on a given creature.

Y <if_flag> <macro-number> <percentage>

<if_flag>       should be 0
<macro-number>  Defines the type of set being loaded (see below)
<percentage>    A percentage chance (recalculated for all slots)

M 0 102 1 104            Elite
Y 0 10 5                    5% chance at metal

Note 1:
if-flag should be 0.  This is so if equipment loads prior to the Y, the Y
will not be bypassed if equipment prior to it fails to load.  You may still
use an if-flag of 1 if you truly wish the load of the set of armor dependent
on the previous command, although I can't see why you would want to do this.

Note 2:
Y re-rolls the <percentage> for all slots.  It is essentially the
equivalent of doing multiple '?', 'E', '?', 'E', '?', 'E' commands

Note 3:
Y should be the LAST equipment command on a given mob.  Any slot that has
already been equipped prior to the Y command execution will be skipped.
This is so you can put specific single items on the creature and then flesh
out all other slots with stock-equipment.

Note 4:
Be careful when setting load rates for armor. An acceptable load rate on a
Y load should be 5 or less as we do not want players cashing in on load
rates.  Speak with a LOW if you want armor above 5% chance load.

Note 5:
Y loads are still subject to max_exist.  If an item is at or over
max_exist, it will not be loaded by a Y command.

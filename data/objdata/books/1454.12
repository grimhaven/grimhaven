The 'R' Command
make a mob ride another mob

The 'R' command loads a mob and causes it to ride the last mob referenced.

R <if_flag> <mob vnum> <max_exist> <room vnum>

<if_flag> is typically 1  (only load it if the previous "mount" loaded)
<mob vnum> is vnum mob is saved as
<max_exist> max# of mob allowed in room
	- see note on end for tips on setting
<room vnum> is the room to put the mob in

M 0 101 4 102        horse
R 1 100 4 102        orc riding

Loads a horse into room 102 then puts an orc on it.  Note that if the max exist
for the orc prevents the command, it will still make the horse (although it will
be rider-less).

This command is somewhat obsolete as there is code to cause humanoid creatures
to attempt to ride any mountable creature they come across.  This command 
forces the action though so you could conceivably force a creature to ride an 
unmountable mount.  It does look stupid though, but you could do it.

Also, avoid putting items onto the mount or the if_flag on the R will be 
dependent on those items being loaded onto the mount.

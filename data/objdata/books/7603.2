Quick Start
-----------

Although it is highly recommended that first time <h> players read the
newbie guide thoroughly, here is a list of things to do for those
who feel they don't need to read help files to play.

1) Consult the following help files.
   NEWBIE
   GOD
   GOTO
   COLOR
   PROMPT
   WEAPON PROFICIENCY
   AUTO
   CONSIDER
   LIMBS
   ITEM DAMAGE
   WIMPY
   ASSIST
   BRIEF
   ABBREVIATIONS
   
2) Go through all help files thoroughly when you have the chance.  Time
   spent regenerating mana, move or hit points is an excellent time to
   read the help files.

3) Before running around killing things, find your trainer and practice. 
   You receive a specific number of practices (dependent on your wisdom
   and intelligence, chapter 12) from character generation. Use the
   "goto" command to find your trainer.

4) Wear all equipment and wield any weapons you find.  You are given some
   basic gear at the outset, but almost anything you find will be better.

5) Visit Center Square for food and water.  'drink fountain' and 'pray'.

6) If you lose your gear as a newbie, you should see the social worker.

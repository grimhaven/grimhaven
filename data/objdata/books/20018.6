                               group.  There will be a special sign up list
                               for those that can't find a group or have 
			       a partial group formed.  Those who
                               enter on that list will be appointed a group
                               upon gametime, but only in groups of 4. If
                               there is a remaining person, that person may 
                               not play unless they find a group. 
                               Appointments are made in order down the list; 
                               First come, first serve.
			       Death does not disqualify you from the race.
			       Group Level Limit: 80 upon signup


GROUP EXPERIENCE CHALLENGE RACE:  A race in which players attempt to
accumulate as many experience points as possible in a group in the given
time limit.  Players will choose their competing characters from any of
their existing PC's but the total levels of the group must be under a
certain number as set below.  The four PC's in a group must also be played
by 4 different players.  All groups will meet at the Mud-wide Contestant's
Lounge in the area above Grimhaven Center Square unless another place is
designated on the Tournament Board or by mail.  Competitors will have
their experience recorded and then have their Quest Flags set.  They will
then have 1 hour to gain as much experience as they can.  There is no
restriction on where players may go to earn this xp, but the same rules
against cheating on <h> apply to this race.  (no free xp policy :)
At the end of the hour, the tournament organizer will record your
experience and compare you to other groups in your level range.  Because
of level limits within groups, PC's may assign their prizes to their main
character even if that character is of a higher level. At time of
pre-registration the total levels of the 4 group members may not exceed
80.

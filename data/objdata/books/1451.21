Max Exist:

This controls how many of an item will be in world before an item will 
stop loading and before hunting code will be activated (if relevant).
This as well as structure and value are the key object values that most 
influence the mud economy.  Max_exist should be set according to how 
powerful an item is.  Simple items and general purpose items should be 
set unlimited (999).  Magic items of any power should be max_exist less 
than or equal to 5.  Super items should be set Max_exist=1  Other max_exist 
ranges are in the 20-30 range.

You should carefully examine The World for the max_exist of similar 
items in The World and set accordingly.  Make good use of LOW command and 
help files under policy.


NOTES:

RESTRICT ANY MAGIC ITEM:  You must set a limited max exist if you have 
set any form of apply other than simple AC.

SERIOUSLY RESTRICT ARTIFACT QUALITY ITEMS:  You must limit artifacts to 
less than 5 in world.

CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE:  Your max exist should conform 
with your max exist in zone file.

CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE PERCENT LOADS:  Low max_exist items
should *not* have hight percentage loads or load on a large number of 
mobs.  Simple math will show you if you have a max exist of 5 and you 
load it 40 percent of time on 12 different mobs, you will reach your max 
exist the first time some group clears a zone.  You should want your 
items to load sparingly for a long time or groups will just clear the 
zone the first week of production and then never come back.

The 'H' & 'F' commands
causes a mob to hate or fear another creature

You may only assign 1 hate and 1 fear per mob.
Hates cause the mob to attack, while fears will make them flee.

H <if_flag> <type> <parameter>
F <if_flag> <type> <parameter>

<if_flag> should be 1 (only apply it if the mob to put it on loaded)
<type> see the list at the end
<parameter> is dependent on <type>

M 0 100 1 101         orc
H 1 1 2                  hate-female
G 1 102 1                brown key

Hates and fears should be directly under the command to make the mob before
any commands dealing with inventory or equipment.

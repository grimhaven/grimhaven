How do I refer to something when there is more than one in the room?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You will often see something like:
A hard roll is here. [2]

This denotes that there are 2 (number in brackets) of the item specified.
Similarly:
A barhopper wanders the streets.  [4]
implies 4 barhoppers are in the room with you.

The default reference is the first one in the room.  If you want to
reference the 2nd, 3rd, ... object, use this format:

(command) 2.(object)    <-- references the 2nd thing of type (object)
eg.
get 2.roll
kick 3.guard
buy 7.sword

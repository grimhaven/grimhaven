The parchment is handwritten in the Common Language.  It reads:
 
    Security report for the last shift:
            Sightings - 268
            Incursions - 21
            Troops Killed - 10
            Equipment loss - unknown
 
    Notes:  The recent earthquake has caused our secret entrances
            to be compromised.  We need more troops to reinforce
            them, or we are likely to suffer more losses.

Volume

The volume of an object is how much room it occupies. The main effect of
volume is that it determines the size of the item and thus, which race(s)
can wear an item.  The second effect is that volume determines the amount
of free space the item will take up in a players inventory. In this
regard, bags and chests have a built in compression ratio (based on
material type) that allows them to "fold the item up and squeeze it into a
bag". Please set the items volume off of the LARGEST size the item could
occupy and let the code do the compressing. 

We expect realistic volume setting.  Please be aware that 1 unit = 1 cubic
inch.  Hence something that is a foot on a side is 12 * 12 * 12 = 1728
units. Use some common sense when setting item volume and be accurate
about it. 

See the note about race and item size (below) to find out about setting 
armor size for particular races to wear..

NOTES:

COMMON BUILDER ERRORS:  Forgetting to set volume at all or setting 
totally unrealistic volume.  Both add a lot of work to the balancing 
process.

PAIRED ITEMS:  These require double volume of single items.

VOLUME:  Remember that volume sets which race can wear an item.

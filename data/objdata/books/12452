Inside you find a note from some shipwrecked pirate....
Aye Matee,
  Be ye warned this here ocean is quite a treacherous place.
Don't you be going near the center as the old mother will
suck you down and spit ya out gods knows where or strip the
meat from yer bones.  Lost me leg from that mother.
  Don't ya be going near those cliffs to the northeast
either. Seen a beast there that will pick the meat off
yor bones sure as anything.  Damn glare from her scales
was enough to blind this poor old one eyed sailor.
  Iffen ya ever meet up with that crazed whale Belimus
just you be swimming for yer life.  He'll swallow ya whole
just a soon as look at ya.  Ya may have heard the rumors of
fellars coming out of his gut alive, but they be far and
few old pirates that lucky.
  Now them there elves down to the south be a friendly
lot generally, but those Saughin enemies of those love
to kill ya just for the sport.
  AAhhh never got a chance but always been told ya
follow the sea down fer enough ya find a whole new land of
adventuring. If ya don't die in that accursed keep that
ya gotta go thru first they say.
  Well me life is coming to end and I just wanted to
warn thee next pirate of these seas what he's up against.
I being throwing myself off this rock of an island I've
called home fer these past 7 years and let the old sea take
me bones home.
  May the treasure always be in yer hold and the wind at
your back!

                          Olde BlackThrone
                             Thee One Eyed Pirate

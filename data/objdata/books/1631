General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
AFTERMATH OF THE THIRD ELF - DWARF WAR

With no human emperor to maintain solidarity amongst the humans, the various
villages had foolishly taken sides in the conflict.  The result was that they
frequently found themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield.  The war
itself had a large number of battles with accompanying bloodshed and tragedy,
but the fine points of which are best left to a military textbook rather then
this general discourse.

It is sufficient to state that these battles created regional strife as one town
grew to hate the neighboring town for their role in such-and-such a battle.
And of course this was reciprocated.  Humanity begin to fragment and the once
mighty civilization it had created became nothing more then small pockets of
allied towns and villages weakly imitating what once had been a global effort.

An uneasy and somewhat false peace settled over the civilized lands.  No longer
was it one united body, but instead a conglomeration of smaller political units
loosely affiliated similarly to the alliances formed during the war.  The
occasional raid and attack still occurred, and reprisals still happened.
Travel was restricted, trade was minimal and foreigners were suspect.

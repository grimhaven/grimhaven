NEWBIE EXPERIENCE CHALLENGE RACE:  A race in which a player attempts to
accumulate as many newbie experience points as possible on his or her own
in the given time limit.  Players will make a newbie character that is one
of their current character's name with a '2' tacked on the end. (ie.  If
my name is Raistlin, my newbie would be Raistlin2.  Simple enough.) To
receive prizes, the winners will log in with the characters they wish to
receive their prizes with.  At the appointed time, all newbie competitors
will meet at the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the area above Grimhaven
Center Square unless another place is designated on the Tournament Board
or by mail.  Competitors will have their experience recorded and then have
their Quest Flags set.  They will then have 1 hour to gain as much
experience as they can.  There is no restriction on where players may go
to earn this xp (feel free to take your newbie out to the Arch Vampire's
Crypt), but the same rules against cheating on <h> apply to this
race.  (no free xp policy :) At the end of the hour, the tournament
organizer will record your experience and compare you to other newbie
characters to determine the winners.

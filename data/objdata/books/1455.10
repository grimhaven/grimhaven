What's the best way to start?
-----------------------------

Chances are, the character you currently have will have to be redone.  I
say this because most new players realize sooner or later the choices they
made at the outset are not optimal for some reason or other.

The first order of business is learning what stats to set.  Read through
the help files on the classes (HELP CLASS) and races (HELP RACE).  Then
talk to people about what they chose and what problems they have.

If in doubt, a human warrior is a very easy class to fiddle around with
to get your feet wet.  The non-human races have a lot of complex rules
that go along with them (but some nice benefits too), while the other
classes have a multitude of skills which often confuse the beginner.

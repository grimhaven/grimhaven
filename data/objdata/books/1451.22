Race and item sizing

The code does internal checks on item size and player size to determine if
a character can fit into an item.  Here's how the system works.

For any item worn (except neck, finger and wielded/held) it determines the
items percent size (%size).  Its %size is the ratio of its volume to a defined
100% size.  The 100% sizes are as follows:
  head:   2500        waist:    4000
  body:  11000        back:     2500
  arm:    2000        leg:      6000
  wrist:   400        foot:     1600
  hand:    800

If the item is paired (pants), it doubles the 100% value before calculating
the %size.

Next it calculates the characters %height.  A character's %height is HEIGHT
divided by 70 inches (average human male height).

A character can wear the item provided:

1.15 * %size > %height > %size * 0.85

The formula is actually this:

perc = height/70 * human-size
if vol > perc/0.85, too big
if vol < perc/1.15, too small



When MAKING objects, just do this.  Get the character's height that should be able
to wear it, divide by 70.  Multiply this number by the 100% value listed
above and use the result as the object's volume.

NOTES:

PAIRED OBJECTS:  Remember to double volume

CONSISTENCY WITH MOB: Make sure the mob on which it will load is the 
right height to wear an object.

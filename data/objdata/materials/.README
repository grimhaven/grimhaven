  This file will explain in quick terms how to add a new material to the game.
Start by being in the lib/objdata/materials directory and:
  cp .TEMPLATE <material name>
Ex:
  cp .TEMPLATE "elven mail"

  Now open up the <material name> file and add the values appropriate to the
material.  There is comments above each entry so it should be easy to do.

  Once that is done edit the .INDEX file and locate the header that reflects
the new entry:
  If it is a mineral then goto:
;MINERAL
  If it is a metal then goto:
;METAL
  If it is an organic then goto:
;ORGANIC

  Now locate the last entry under that header, but before the next one, and
place the name of the material on the next line:

  This:
rubber

;METAL
iron
steel

;MINERAL

  Would become:
rubber

;METAL
iron
steel
elven mail

;MINERAL


  That is it.

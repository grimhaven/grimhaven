Syntax: pray <prayer> {target}
        pray <prayer> me
        pray <prayer> self
        pray <prayer> tank

The pray command allows clerics or deikhans to beseech their deity for aid 
provided the supplicant has sufficient piety to make the request.

<prayer> may be abbreviated, although realize the dangers of thinking that
something like CUR was "cure poison" when in reality it might be "curse".  For
multiple word prayers (heal light, word of recall, etc.) you can abbreviate all
words.  eg. pray hea lig {target}

Not all prayers require a {target}.  If no target is specified but one is 
needed, {target} is either the person you are fighting (offensive prayer) or 
the cleric.

Unlike DIKUs, <h>'s spell system does not require the use of a ' to surround
the prayers.

Some prayers have their effect at the end of a praying period. Some are 
immediate and some give effects while the Cleric is praying.  The latter type
of prayer can generally be made to "stop" or "continue".  Continuing a spell
will make it of indefinite duration till it is stopped, continue finished or
the cleric has run out of Piety.

Generally, all prayers require the use of an attuned holy symbol and use piety.
However, some prayers require other material components and take hit points or
vitality.  If a cleric runs out of piety, the gods may take vitality until the
Cleric is exhausted. 

When you are grouped with someone in a fight you can use "tank" as the target
name to auto-select whomever your enemy is bashing away at.

Each prayer should have its own help file.  help <prayer>

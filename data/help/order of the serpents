The Order of the Serpent is one of the more recent additions to the geopolitical
religious scene.  Arising during the time of the Schism, they began as a
group of reformers but have more recently become both more mercantile and
mercenistic in their desires.

The Order's stated goal is to reform the existing factions so as to wipe the
taint of corruption that has plagued both in recent centuries.  They are
also technically promoting peaceful coexistence between both the Cult and the
Brotherhood.

In truth, and in fact the Order is more interested in its own selfish ends.
Merchants that profit from the ongoing conflict and that trade with both sides
play a large role in the Order's membership.  Men-at-arms and other mercenaries
also call them home.  These two group's needs often contradict with Order's
stated goals of reform.  The Order has been known to openly assist one faction
or another in the name of generating influence with them, but in point of fact
simply for the value of the talens that they have been paid to do so.

The Order makes its home in the town of Amber, but does not deny access to
this town to either opposing faction.  They permit outposts within their
borders in the name of harmony and also send envoys to exert their power
elsewhere.  Some public improvements have also been constructed by previous,
more civic-minded leaders of the Order, most notable amongst these are the
defensive works near the tundra frontier.

Certain lesser faeries have in recent years shown that a weak alliance is
being formed between them and the Order.  A number of non-civilized elven
folks have been known to assist the Order from time to time, although generally
only when the Order is truly working for reform.

Syntax: spells <offensive|utility> <targeted|nontargeted> <all>

The spells command allows you to view your spells by category.  The targeted/
nontargeted options refer to whether or not the spell targets an individual
person.  Spells that target objects are considered to be nontargeted.  The all
option shows all the spells of a particular type, whether or not you have
learned them yet.

Each line lists the spell name, your current learnedness of the spell, your max
learnedness of the spell, the number of component charges for the spell that
you have available and the name of the required component.

Usage examples:

spells offensive
spells offensive targeted
spells utility nontargeted all

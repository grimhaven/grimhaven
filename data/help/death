There are three types of deaths on <h>, complete, partial and reconnect.

A complete death results whenever a character's hit points reach -10 or
fewer.  This is most often the result of combat, but may occur under other
circumstances, such as walking off a cliff and falling.  Starvation and
drowning are the other chief culprits.  A complete death results in the
following penalties:  loss of XP (amount based on formula in HELP FORMULAS),
the creation of a corpse with all equipment and talens in it, a slight
increase in player's age (random).  Typically, a complete death will
repair the victim of any ailments (poison, bleeding, etc) and fill the
stomach with food and drink.  Additionally, pets and other NPC followers
will abandon you following a complete death.

A partial death is the result of entering a deadly situation in which (in the
opinion of the implementors), a complete death was not warranted.  Partial
deaths generally cause the creation of a corpse, but do not effect xp or
age.  Partial deaths are the result of stumbling into a deathtrap or 
encountering other instantaneous-death situations.  Like a complete death,
NPC followers will abandon you following a complete death.

A reconnect death is the result of reconnecting with negative hit points.
Reconnect deaths will incur loss of xp and age increase but will not create
a corpse.  Reconnect deaths are automatically generated whenever certain
conditions are met.  The announcement of such an event is shown at the time
of the reconnect.  Reconnect deaths do not result in the loss of NPC followers.

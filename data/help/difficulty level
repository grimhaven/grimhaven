The difficulty level of a spell is a value that depicts how easy or how
difficult it is to cast a spell with a high level of efficiency to produce
the desired results.  The range of values is TRIVIAL, EASY, NORMAL, DIFFICULT, 
and DANGEROUS.  These values dictate the spell caster's chances of
successfully casting the spell, casting the spell perfectly (gaining bonuses),
or accidentally screwing up, which could lead to unwanted results, like 
possible death, dismemberment or backfiring on the caster.

It should also be noted that circumstances under which the spell is cast
often modify the difficulty level.  For example, a high level player casting
a basic spell may receive a benefit.  Likewise, being constrained (knocked
over, drunk, etc) may impede the chances for success.

Syntax: save
Syntax: toggle showsaves

Saves your character. This includes experience points, characteristics, 
current skill proficiencies, talens, equipment and the like.

Saving should be done after anything beneficial happens to you to ensure
that the fact that it happened is registered by the updater.  Saving is done
automatically whenever you: drop an item, get an item, sell an item, gain a 
level, interact with a shop, or die.  Additionally, if you haven't saved in 
quite some time you will be saved automatically.

You should definitely save after retrieving your corpse following a death or
any other landmark achievement.

The showsaves toggle will display "Saving." every time the game automatically
saves your character for you.

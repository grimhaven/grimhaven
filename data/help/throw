Syntax: throw <object> {direction} {character | distance}

Throw is the command used to throw things in an aggressive manner.
You must specify what is to be thrown, and that <object> must be both
held in your primary hand as well as adequately designed to be thrown.

The other two parameters will yield a larger chance of hitting who you
intended.

throw dagger 		: This would throw the dagger in a random direction
               		  from your room
throw dagger west 	: The dagger would be thrown west, but would
			  not be aimed at anything specific or thrown
			  with any specific range.
throw dagger west guard : This would throw your dagger west at the
                          first guard you can see to your west.
throw dagger west 1     : This would throw your dagger west one room
                          at no one in particular.

Thrown items have a small chance of hitting the wrong person, if
that person 'gets in the way' of the thrown item.

Beware that even though you don't specify a victim, a thrown object
always has the chance to hit someone of something in its path. You
might hit something you don't want to hit by throwing an object.

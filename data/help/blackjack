The blackjack table is located in the casino.  You must sit at the
blackjack table to start.  You must place a bet to get the cards dealt.
Syntax: BET <chip>

The object of blackjack is to acquire cards totalling as close to 21 points
as possible without going over ("bust").  Cards count their face value,
face cards are 10 points, aces can be counted as either 1 or 11 points.
A blackjack occurs if one player receives an ace and a face card on the
deal (11 + 10 = 21).  A blackjack is an automatic win for that person.

You can take as many cards as you want by "hitting".  This will give you
an additional card.  You can take as many hits as you want.
Syntax: HIT

You stop taking cards by "staying pat".  Once you stay, the dealer has
the opportunity to hit.
Syntax: STAY

After the dealer has hit himself sufficiently, the cards are revealed.
Whoever came closer to 21, wins.  If someone busted while hitting, the
other person automatically wins.

The dealer is required to hit while his cards are 16 or less, and must
stay on 17 or greater.  The house will pay 1:1 on a push.  (Vegas rules)

Syntax: quit!

Note that because many terminal programs use "quit" as a way to exit them,
we changed this command to "quit!" hopefully to avoid accidental use.

Quit is a command that should almost never be employed by a good adventurer.
You must type the full word "quit!" because it has drastic results and we
don't want you to have it happen accidentally.  Basically, quit makes you
drop all of your items (worn and inventory) in the present square and makes
you leave the game out to the main option menu screen.  Because of the fact
that all of your items are dropped, it is not a recommended way of leaving
the game.  If for some reason, you have no items, it is a perfectly acceptable
way of leaving.

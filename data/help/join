Syntax: toggle join

The join toggle will mark whether you are willing to join a faction
at this time.  Faction leaders will be unable to add you as a member
of their faction if join is toggled off.  

Keep this toggled off if you have no intention of joining a faction.
Be sure to toggle it on if you decide you would like to join a faction
in order to allow your faction leader to add you to the faction.

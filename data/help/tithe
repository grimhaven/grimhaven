Syntax: tithe <amount>

Tithing is the method by which a faction raises wealth.  Tithing transfers
money from you directly to the faction's treasury.  A faction may require
an automatic tithe which will be deducted whenever you get talens.  The
required tithe is displayed in the information when you "list factions".

Additionally, in any major bank of The World, you may make a donation of any
amount you feel is appropriate.  <amount> will be subtracted from your money
and added to the faction's treasury.  A faction leader may make withdrawals
from the faction treasury by specifying a negative <amount>.

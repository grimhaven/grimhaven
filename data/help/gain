Syntax: gain

Whenever you have gained a new level through experience, you can visit
your guildmaster for some sage advice and tutelage.  If you are a new
adventurer still exploring grimhaven, you may use the 'goto guildmaster'
command to find your guildmaster.  Once you are at your guildmaster, simply
type 'gain'.  They will then give you advice on how to spend your practices,
new quests available to you, and other guidance.

Not all guildmasters are alike.  Eventually, you will need to explore the
world about you in order to find a person who will be capable of teaching you
the more advanced lessons.

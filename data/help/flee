Syntax: flee {direction}

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
just type 'flee' and you will run from the room in a random direction.

You must be physically able to leave the room and there must be a suitable
exit.  The flee command will attempt to make you stand in order to escape,
but this is not always successful.  Broken limbs or other maladies may
further prevent your escape.  If you are mounted, you will generally leap 
from off your mount in order to flee.

Be wary of your surroundings when fleeing to minimize the chances that you
will end up going from the frying pan to the fire.  Also remember that if
you've hit the mob, it will track you, so you may not be safe for long.

Flee has a chance of causing the loss of experience points as it is considered
an ignoble disgrace (but better than dying).  The retreat skill can help reduce
this chance somewhat.

You may specify {direction} to flee in, but there is no guarantee that that is
the actual direction you will head in.  Your chance of going in the desired
direction is proportional to your learnedness in retreat.

If you are not tanking, you can use the disengage command to get out of combat.
Flee can be used while casting but will add command lockout.

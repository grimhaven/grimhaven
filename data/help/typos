Syntax:	typo

This will drop you into	a simple editor	similar	to the in-MUD mail system.

Type ~ and return on a blank line to report the typo, or ` on a blank line to       
cancel your typo report.

Typos generally do not receive responses.  If you have a bug to report, an idea
to suggest or any other type of help request, use the BUG, IDEA or REQUEST
commands, respectively.

Typo reports display who gave the report as well as where in the game the typo
is being reported from, so this information can be left out of a report.

We appreciate the reporting of typos.  Obviously, we try to avoid them, but
sometimes they just slip in.  We're grateful for your sharp eyes and willingness 
to spend a bit of your time alerting us to our error!

Alternatively, you may visit http://www.sneezymud.com/Contact_Us.html and fill 
out the	web form to report the typo.

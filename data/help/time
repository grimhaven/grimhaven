Syntax: time
Syntax: time <difference>

The time command tells you the time of day the game is currently in.
It has no relationship on the real world.  Game time controls such things
as sunlight, shop opening and closing times.

The time in the real world is also shown.  This time is based on the mud's
host clock and adjusted based on the time-adjustment you set (see below).

If the game is in shutdown-mode, the time remaining until the shutdown will
occur is also shown.

Time with a parameter will alter the time-adjustment between your local site
and the site at which <h> is run.  This is used to control the display of
real time clocks and such.  <h> is presently run on the west coast.  The
east coast is +3 (time 3) hours difference.

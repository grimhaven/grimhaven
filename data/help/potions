Potions are liquids that imbue any who drink of it with magical qualities.
Standard potions come in flasks or vials and provide only one drink's worth
of liquid.

The magic has a tendency to discolor the liquid that contains it, and the
wise adventurer will spend some time learning what colors yield what effects.

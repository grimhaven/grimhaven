Syntax: assist <person>

Assist causes you to begin fighting the same creature that person is fighting.
Assist is similar to the rescue skill except the <person> continues fighting
and tanking.  It is better than kill in many cases because you do not have to
choose between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room).

Fast Typer Caveat:  When a mob starts a fight, it picks the last person
who hit it as the one to attack.  This means that if Tank attacks Mob, and
Dummy assists in the split second before the Mob picks its attacker, the
Mob will wind up fighting Dummy.  Bottom line, assisting before the first
full combat round goes by is dangerous.

Solo casters without weapons will default to "engaged" status on
assisting.  If you do not want to merely engage, you can wield a weapon or
type hit after assisting.  Fighters (and wielding casters) will default to
hitting on assists and can then disengage if they do not wish to hit.

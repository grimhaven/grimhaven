Strength represents a character's physical might.

In game terms, strength is utilized for manipulating "weight".  eg.
Stronger characters are able to lift heavier loads, wield heavier
weapons, open larger doors or shove/drag larger creatures.  There are
also some combat bonuses associated with above average strength. 

note: do not confuse "weight" with "volume".  See dexterity for more
details.

Faction, or affiliation, percent (often abbreviated FP) represents your degree
of purity and loyalty in adhering to the belief system of your faction.  FP
typically goes up when you do things that aid your faction, or the allies of
your faction, and drops when you bad things to those same people.  Similarly,
harming the enemies of your faction will raise your FP, while giving aid to
the enemy lowers it.

FP has a great effect on clerics and deikhans  as the more or less pure they
are, the more powerful their prayers will be.

FP also seems to have some relation to the potency of a faction's deities.
Deities that run low on power are less willing to grant piety regeneration,
and also, are less willing to save their followers from unlucky situations.

Syntax: title {string}

The title command can be used to set your title.  You must be at least
5th level to use this command.  Title changes the statement that is shown
when people use the WHO command.

The string can be any statement you would like, with the only restriction
being that you MUST put <<n> somewhere in it.  The <<n> is replaced with
the characters name when it appears.  You can also enter color codes
using the standard color string < > syntax.

For example :
    title I am a killer, says <<n>. 
	would set your title to be :
    I am a killer, says ,<player name>.

    title I am a <<r>killer<<z>, says <<n>. 
	would set your title to be :
    I am a <r>killer<z>, says <player name>.

It is generally considered poor etiquette to have obnoxious, denigrating
or exceptionally long titles.  Really cool people have titles that are
surreal and bizarre.

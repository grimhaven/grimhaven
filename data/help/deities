Deities are the varied and sundry powers that be upon The World.  The only 
creatures more powerful than a deity are the gods themselves.  While the
gods do not play favorites and have few dealings in the realm of mortals,
deities frequently interfere and play games according to their own unique 
rules.

Deities are best known as the force behind cleric's and deikhan's prayers. 
No one, save perhaps the deities and maybe the gods, understands how the
prayers work, suffice to say, there are notable examples to prove that
magical forces are not involved, at least not in any way as presently
understood by any of today's best minds in magic. 

As noted above, deities frequently interfere in the realms of mortals.  While
the rules of interference are not well understood, it should be noted that
upsetting a deity is not something that should be done by people trying to
avoid death.  What is known is that there is a power structure between the
various interests amongst the deities.  The power is based on the actions of
the followers of those deities, and is consumed by those followers in the form
of interventions or when piety is regenerated to the worshipers of the 
deities.  The best way to please a deity is by increasing that deity's power.

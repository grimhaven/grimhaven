03-25-99 : HELP FUTURE VERSION updated.

------------ End of v5.0 changes -----------------
03-23-99 : The mud is now in a frozen state and no further development on
           this version (save to fix crash bugs, and exploits) will be done.
03-23-99 : Mobs with limbs made missing will have reduced exp.
03-23-99 : Mobs limb HP increased due to excess of useless limbs.
03-23-99 : Deathstroke damage put on damage scale.
03-23-99 : Zones command output will be sorted now.
03-23-99 : The overall speed of the mud has been increased slightly to make
           it less sluggish.  This basically means everything will happen
           faster (or more often depending).
03-18-99 : New Command : ZONES
03-17-99 : Fixed problem in ice storm spell that was keeping success rate
           on this spell low.
03-17-99 : Fixed problem preventing some mobs from tracking properly.
03-17-99 : A small calculation error for offense/defense skills effect on
           hit rates corrected.  You probably won't notice any change since
           the two were most like canceling each other out before.
03-16-99 : Auto nospam suppresses the list of each item's rent upon renting
           now.  You can still use offer to see the breakdown.
03-13-99 : No-drop-in-shops removed in favor of more efficient janitor force.
03-13-99 : Component use logic further refined so that it avoids using
           0-cost components if at all possible.  Otherwise, it uses 
           component with fewest charges.
03-13-99 : Immobilize fail differentiates between regular and critical fail
           now.
03-12-99 : Reduced the command lock-out and loss of attacks for getting and
           wearing items in combat.
03-12-99 : You can no longer be bodyslammed if you are already on the ground.
03-11-99 : As some might have noticed.  It is now possible to block a mob
           when they try and switch to a fellow group member during combat.
03-11-99 : Grimhaven's cleanup crew (AKA the janitors) is a bit more efficient
           about finding clutter and moving it to the Surplus.
03-11-99 : Added 'donate' command.
03-09-99 : You can now get dropped weapons while berserking.
03-08-99 : Fixed the problem causing the mud to hang forever.  Sorry about
           that.
03-07-99 : You will no longer junk containers with contents if you have
           auto-pouch set.  See HELP TOGGLE
03-07-99 : Smooth and Sharpen will now default to your currently held weapon
           if none is specified.
03-05-99 : Added 'exp_tolevel' to prompt, uses the 'exp' field for color.
03-05-99 : Bandage will now default to the user and will also auto-find the
           first bleeding limb if none specified.
02-25-99 : Current session earned xp is now in score.
02-24-99 : Bodyslam has been looked at more in depth for the skills damage
           stuff.  The damage remains the same, however, due to the strength
           and dex constraints that have to be passed to successfully lift
           the victim up, we were able to justify a longer lockout period for
           the victim upon success.
02-24-99 : Failure to meet rent obligations will cause pets (and their
           items) to be confiscated BEFORE your own items are sold off.
           Pets, and their items, are NOT sold one-by-one like your own items
           would be, so if you are even 1 talen over, expect to lose all pets
           and all their items (with the proper credit for all of it).
02-24-99 : Due to unpopularity, the roundless combat experiment has been
           terminated, and combat rounds are back in.  However, some of
           the changes made to support roundless combat, like showing
           lockout times in seconds, have been left in place, as they seem
           to be better.  Also, while "rounds" are back, the blows within
           that round are still traded between combatants in a back and forth
           manner similar to how roundless was doing it, but simply clustered
           into a round.  Just fight, you'll see what I mean...
02-23-99 : Item duplication bug in flamestrike fixed.
02-23-99 : Components in closed (spell)bags will not be used when selling
           all.components or when casting.
02-22-99 : The opponent prompt will show "ENGAGED" inside it if engaged.
02-19-99 : Component usage will now pick the one with the highest rent cost,
           followed by the one with the least charges.
02-19-99 : Problem with mob hatred and fear not working fixed.  Should have a
           downstream effect on hunting and aggro-code etc.
02-18-99 : Combat speed has been ratched back up to the speed it was at
           prior to introduciton of roundless combat.  Messages will come
           fast and furious now, but at least you won't have to wait so
           long for combat to finish.
02-18-99 : The auto-bit for spam reduction will now cause the "secs lockout"
           in the prompt to be truncated to minimum size.
02-18-99 : Mage's rent credit now reflects an allotment to cover the cost of
           components.
02-18-99 : A new pricing scheme for components and magic items is in effect.
02-17-99 : Command lockout will now be displayed with your prompt to aid
           in figuring skill lag.
02-16-99 : Skill Damage Tweak : A correction intended to equalize skill
           damage for NPC vs PC was having a bad effect on PC v PC battles
           and has been corrected.  Complaints based on that sort of testing
           should be fixed.
02-13-99 : *** HELP SNEEZY *** for answers to your confusion.
02-12-99 : Strange happenings have been reported near the Logrus Cemetery.
02-08-99 : Fixed problem with engagement and new roundless combat.
02-05-99 : Upgrade for SneezyMUD client, Version 5.5 19990205
02-05-99 : Consider self will now take into account the same class-based
           adjustments that rent credit looks at when evaluating your AC.
           This has no effect on warriors, but it should be a more accurate
           evaluation of your AC based on your level AND class.  This is
           strictly a change in how it evaluates, not a change in the
           underlying AC.
02-04-99 : Added 'anonymous' to flag.
02-04-99 : Healing Prayer tweak : Put the healing prayers on the same scale
           as other prayer/spells are on for damage.  Some Cleric mobs were
           able to heal themselves MUCH faster than they were taking damage.
02-03-99 : Made falling off a horse in combat a bit less frequent.
02-03-99 : Spell Damage Tweak : Spell/Prayer damage against creatures of
           greater level has been scaled downward based on the level
           difference.
02-03-99 : Support for MSP, MUD Sound Protocol, is now enabled although it
           is fairly limited right now.  You will need to be using an MSP-
           capable client to take advantage of MSP.  See HELP TERMINAL.
02-02-99 : SneezyMUD is beginning some experimentations with "roundless
           combat".  Previously, each round was roughly 3 seconds apart and
           you would get all of your attacks in one fell swoop each round.
           Under roundless combat situations, your attacks are split up over
           the round so that you may in fact be getting 1 attack every second
           (spread out evenly) where before you were getting 3 hits per round.
           It's not clear whether this is truly better or not and may be
           subject to review and/or removal.
02-02-99 : XP Tweak : Level bonus (and consequentially the XP bonus) mobs
           receive based on their class has been corrected for the numerous
           recent changes.  This doesn't do anything to difficulty, but makes
           similar difficulty mobs award similar XP.
02-01-99 : Thief Tweak : Backstab damage put on the skill-damage scale.
02-01-99 : More free deaths awarded simply because it's been awhile and we've
           done a number of tweaks.
01-30-99 : Added some new fields to score, and modified some of the current
           ones.
01-30-99 : Monk Tweak : After accounting for the dodge skill success rate,
           dodge should now be blocking more hits.  The briefly inconsequential
           Oomlat Philosophy skill has been redefined so that it lowers the
           monk's chance of being hit in combat.
01-30-99 : Combat Tweak : Damage (both skill and melee) has been globally
           reduced for both mobs and PCs.  This was done principally to 
           stretch out how long combat takes since most fights were averaging
           3-5 rounds.
01-29-99 : Fixed problem with combat skills (offense, defense, proficiencies,
           specializations) not increasing.
01-29-99 : Monk Tweak : The Jirin skill has been improved so that monk
           dodging occurs more often.
01-29-99 : Combat Tweak : Caught an error that was causing +todam to be
           added in multiple times.  Made appropriate corrections.
01-29-99 : Revamped the list command for shops.  See HELP LIST for more
           information.
01-28-99 : New client release for testing, http://sneezy.stanford.edu/client/
01-28-99 : Combat Tweak : Some adjustments made to how combat damage for PCs
           is derived from weapon damage, skills and stats.  This should not
           have had a major impact on anyone.
01-28-99 : Combat Tweak : The opening round of combat (where the other guy
           doesn't hit) is now limited to a single swing.
01-27-99 : Monk Tweak : Analyzed monk melee in comparison to generalized melee
           and made some modifications to how monk's barehand damage and number
           of hits is calculated.  The generalized numbers are still in place
           with monks getting high number of hits at high level, and
           exceptional barehand damage, but the specific numbers may have
           changed.
           Also note that number of hits is now controlled by the barehand
           proficiency and specialization skills, while kubo still controls
           damage per hit.
01-27-99 : You can now do: search <direction> for specificed searches.
01-25-99 : Combat Tweak : Reanalyzed dual-wielding vs single-wielding.  Weapons
           in offhand now do a reduced amount of damage; essentially 50%,
           although the dual wield skill raises this amount.
01-24-99 : Fixed long standing bug with opening grates/gates with keys
           that has similar names.
01-23-99 : After a tediously long construction process, with numerous
           "oopsies", the Gnome Village of Gnath has been completed.
           A courier for the Gnomes, "three finger/four toes" Geloam,
           arrived to seek formal recognition from the King of Grimhaven.
           The temporary seat of power in the gnome foothills has been
           converted to an outpost with the Chief of the Gnomes returning
           to Gnath to take the governship.  Thanks to Smyrke for this
           area.
01-23-99 : Exhausted and filthy a group of workers has emerged from
           beneath Brightmoon after months of work to proclaim the sewers
           fit for exploration.  Thanks to Hylidan for this area.
01-22-99 : Bash was modified due to complaints.  It no longer causes any
           loss of hits, but does comparible command-lock-out to victim as
           basher.
01-21-99 : Economy Tweak : Balancing initiative is taking a small diversion
           into the economic problems and taking corrective actions.  To
           start with, some new global modifiers are in place that will scale
           the price a shop BUYS an item for (i.e. when you sell it).  These
           modifiers are self-correcting (we hope) such that shops will 
           slightly make a profit in the big scheme of things.  Commodities
           are excepted from the above.
01-20-99 : Southwest of Grimhaven, near the old Volcano, it seems a group
           of workers supposedly having received visions from their deity
           Knighit, have found a lost jungle path.  As of yet little has 
           been reported otherwise about this area.
01-20-99 : Rent Tweak : After further thought, it was decided to do away with
           wearability as a modifier to item pricing, and simply to adjust
           rent credit for the various classes instead.  The upshot of this is
           that item pricing no longer includes any artificial inflation
           (hence should be cheaper), but some class's rent credit has
           decreased.  However, due to the way rent credit is stored, no old
           player's rent credit has dropped, but, it may be a few levels
           before you gain any more rent credit.
01-19-99 : Armor Tweak : Price modification due to wearability is undergoing
           some refinement.  That is, if a mage is able to wear the armor,
           the price of the armor is artificially inflated (wearability).
           This isn't new, but the actual values of the inflation are
           undergoing review as part of the overall balance scheme.
01-19-99 : Armor Tweak : The LOW staff have reviewed many of the armor suits
           that form the guidelines for the building staff.  Many of these
           suits needed small modifications in order to get the AC and
           structure of the armor to approximate the desired level.  That is,
           if the LOW decreed that a given suit was for a given level, then
           this was simply insuring that that suit had the AC and structure
           appropriate for that level too.  Changes to AC and struct *DID*
           impact pricing (according to the formula).  YOU SHOULD BE AWARE
           THAT IF YOUR ARMOR NOW COSTS MORE, IT IS BECAUSE THE CONVERSION
           GAVE IT BETTER STATS.  If your rent has gone up from armor costs,
           it's because you were rewarded with better armor for free.
01-19-99 : Spell Tweak : Some adjustments were made to the basic AC
           inducing spells/prayers both to correct them for the AC change
           and to have them properly addressed in terms of the skill damage
           formula.  For the most part, they provide less AC now, but are
           learned earlier and faster than before.
01-19-99 : It would seem the spies of The World can now overhear whispers.
01-19-99 : Autoeat will now pick the food item closest to spoiling to eat.
01-15-99 : Skills damage tweak : Factoring in more information about each
           class's powers led to another shift in the skills damage system.
           All classes, except warriors, had skill damage increases as a
           result.
01-15-99 : Fixed variety of shoot bugs: hitting groupmates in same room, not
           able to shoot what you can scan.
01-15-99 : Fixed weight problem where you couldn't lift an item out of a bag
           you were carrying.
01-14-99 : Armor Tweak : The AC system has shifted from -100 to 100 scale to
           -1000 to 1000.  Effectively, everything is 10* what is was before.
           The reason for this change was to provide greater granularity in
           armor, especially as it related to equipment.
01-14-99 : Due to the armor tweak, saved equipment has been modified. 
           Essentially, all old equipment has been replaced with the new
           equivalent.  The armor/struct of eq may have changed, and as a
           result had some shifting in price (possibly up or down).  Apologies
           for nuking old-eq, but as compensation, all gear will also be at
           brand-new condition and any partially-used stuff has also
           regenerated.
01-13-99 : Fixed a small oopsie in skill damage calculator that was making
           some skills do negligible damage.  Sorry about that  :)
01-13-99 : Fixed some spells that add to +hitroll to properly work with
           current combat system (previously, were being ignored).
01-13-99 : Due to high failure rate, ride was changed to a trivially difficult
           skill (from normal difficulty).
01-13-99 : Conceal can now be turned off with: conceal off/stop <target>
01-13-99 : Race Tweak : Forgot to account for the no-shoes penalty on hobbits
           when doing racial balance, slight increase in hobbit int/wis as a
           result.  Forgot to account for can't-swim penalty for dwarves, 
           slight boost of dwarven dex/agi as a result.
01-12-99 : Skill Tweak : How skill specialization affects skill damage cap
           has changed somewhat.
01-12-99 : The split command can now be used to make one hide into multiple
           hides.  See HELP SPLIT for more information.
01-12-99 : Flight now makes you a bit too conspicuous to steal things.
01-12-99 : Levitate now lifts you a few inches off the ground (allowing you
           to reach higher, etc).
01-12-99 : Mortals will now be able to sell hides to organic shops.
01-11-99 : Added some color to the tank prompt addition for ansi users.
01-10-99 : After a heated discussion Taloc has agreed to turn the name of
           his bowstring provider over to Balinor.  In the agreement Taloc
           is allowed to continue his trade of bowstrings, but he will no
           longer stock any others then those he buys from his customers.
01-10-99 : Rumors speak that the magical lands southwest of Grimhaven near
           the ancient volcano have been wiped from the lands. At this
           time it is unclear if this was an offensive attack or a move by 
           the citizens of this land to relocate their magical city.  An
           explorer has returned to tell of odd happenings on an island
           in the southwest portion of the Northern Myrian Ocean, there 
           may be a connection.
01-10-99 : Recognizing a need for markets in bulk organic, herbal and
           fabric commodities, shops have opened in both the fair city of
           Grimhaven and Amber to deal in these items.  They believe their 
           biggest trade at the time will be in bulk hides and skins that 
           the rangers and trappers of the realm bring them.  If their trade 
           proves successful it is no doubt that other shops will follow.
01-10-99 : Skinning and Search have both been completely redone.  Skinning
           is now based around the corpse in question and search has been
           moved over to a task.  If problems are found with either,
           feedback goes to Lapsos.
01-09-99 : Skills Tweak : A new, simplified formula is in place for
           determining skill/spell/prayer success.  It is based upon learning
           in the skill, difficulty of the skill and focus.  Other factors,
           position, weather, terrain, etc. will be added in once the basic
           formula can be certified as working OK.
01-09-99 : Skills Tweak : The skills damage formula has been adjusted to
           account for success rates.  Basically, skills that succeed less
           (assuming normal focus) do more damage.
01-09-99 : Due to recent complaints by the general populace the mage's
           guild has decided to stop funding magical shops with unlimited
           items of severly offensive magics.  Such items may still be bought 
           and sold by dealers or on the open market, but will no longer be 
           supplied in mass quanties to licensed shop keepers of magical items.
01-09-99 : Fixed the change hands bug not changing held objects.  Unlock
           and lock should also ignore keys now.
01-05-99 : Skills Tweak : It was pointed out that since NPCs don't do as
           much combat damage as PCs (due to balance considerations), that
           their skill damage should also be lessened.  This has been done.
01-05-99 : Uncovered and fixed a bug that was causing mobs to receive pracs
           as if they had an int of 150.  They should now get their pracs
           according to their actual intelligence.
01-05-99 : The "Est armor class" listing under consider has been improved
           somewhat to account for mobs and PCs being on different scales for
           AC.  Actual AC hasn't changed any, but the way consider reports
           "better" or "worse" has. 
01-04-99 : Adjustments made to the skills damage scale to account for 
           learning in the skill's specialization discipline.  Basically,
           specialization in the skill will raise the cap (allowing you to
           do more damage).  This applies to spells and prayers too.
01-04-99 : Skills Tweak : Remaining offensive skills/spells/prayers are all
           on new scale now.
01-03-99 : Slight change to "who -p" option.  It will now reveal the formation
           of all PC groups.
01-03-99 : Skills Tweak : Mage spells from air, earth, fire, sorcery,
           water disc converted to new scale.
           Bash converted to new scale.
01-02-99 : Skills Tweak : Started analysis of class balance and have made
           some internal changes to how skill damage is calculated.  Thus
           far, only the warrior skills are using the new formulae.  For
           the most part, warrior skills are doing slightly more than
           previously, although each skill has a cap on the damage it will
           inflict.
01-02-99 : Combat Tweak : Redid the formula used to calculate per hit
           damage for PCs.  The base dam is about 75% higher (as in, you
           do more). However, there is no longer a boost for specializing
           since weapon spec is already factored into more hits per round.
           Additionally, some tweaks were made to the impact of strength's
           effects on damage (high does more, low does less).  I believe
           the net effect for all PCs is they will do more.
01-02-99 : Mobs will slightly benefit from the above change too as they pick
           up some piggybacked effects from the characteristic (strength)
           change.  Adjustments were made to counteract this.  Additionally,
           it looks like mobs were getting a slightly bigger bump from
           strength then they should have, so this was also fixed.  Net effect
           should be that mobs do slightly less dam now.
12-29-98 : Rangers can now actually practice pierce specialization.
12-29-98 : Combat Tweak : Redid how offense/defense skills were calculated
           into hit rate formula (shouldn't see much effect from this).
           +tohit now plays a bigger role.  L50+ mobs shouldn't be quite
           as hard to hit now.
12-28-98 : Added new thief skill in the looting discipline: counter steal
12-28-98 : You will no longer be distracted from your prayer/spell from
           fighting unless you are actually fighting.  If victim is uncon,
           you likewise will not suffer distraction.
12-28-98 : Some spells that had previously been unusable in combat are now
           usuable in combat.  Primarily, these are cleric healing spells,
           such as restore limb, cure poison, etc.
12-28-98 : Equipment tweak: After the previous change where armor was forced
           into compliance with what the internal formulas recommend the
           builder's use, it was suggested the same should be done for
           weapons.  So, weapon prices have undergone a transformation.
           As before, item's saved have the better of the old cost or new cost.
           Rental cost follows the same trend.
12-28-98 : Minor modifications in racial characteristics for dwarf, hobbit
           and gnome.
12-25-98 : DAM TWEAK : Made an adjustment in how damage was calculated that
           only impacts newbie PCs.  They will basically be doing about
           twice the dam they were before.
12-25-98 : Merry Christmas!  More free deaths to compensate for the changes.
12-25-98 : RACIAL TWEAK : The base stats for the various PC playable races
           have been realigned in light of some of the combat changes.  This
           change is meant to create some balance between the races (benefits
           offset detriments) while still maintaining the conceptual
           definitions of that race (ogres strong, elves smart, etc).
           HELP RACES OVERVIEW has been updated with the details.
           I have opted NOT to grandfather any impact of this change.  That is
           if your character's race use to have a higher con, you get to keep
           the +HP/lev that this would yield.  However, the reverse is also
           true.  Realize this affects practices as well.  This decision is
           subject to change, but for now, I don't want to penalize old chars
           (nor do I want to work up some conversion that is fair).
12-25-98 : EXP Tweak : Reanalyzed last XP change, and it seems it had some
           significant flaws and was not doing what it was intended to in
           terms of doubling the xp properly.  I believe it also had some
           very adverse effects in mid/low range in terms of gaining XP
           for leveling easily.  Hopefully, this new formula corrects those
           problems.  New scale is 1 billion to L50 but maintains former
           principles in teerms of number of kills to level.
12-24-98 : You will use different amounts of bandages based on race now.
12-24-98 : Changed the colors on the exit directions list on look room:
           Fire:red, Air:cyan, Water:blue, Normal:purple
           The colors are bold if the exit is an open door.
12-23-98 : New auto bit: tips:  Mostly to provide REAL BASIC information to
           newbies periodically.  If folks have ideas for more tips, plop
           them in ideas.
12-21-98 : LEVELING TWEAK : Adjusted the HP bonus per level for CON to bring
           some parity between the various stats that impact combat (con,agi,
           dex, str, bra, spe).
12-21-98 : COMBAT TWEAK : SPE now affects how many blows you will get in
           combat.
12-21-98 : Tank_other is now a natural prompt addition for vt100/ansi users.
12-21-98 : COMBAT TWEAK : Adjustments made to how DEX and AGI modify hitting
           chance.
12-21-98 : Berzerk is now an extra 50% chance of attack with primary hand, and
           an extra 50% chance of attack with secondary hand.
12-21-98 : A portal in time has been discovered within the Gazebo in
           Grimhaven's Park.  Feel free to explore this area.
12-20-98 : The seekwater, track, and trail seek skills have been completely
           redone.  All three are now tasked and should be more friendly.
12-19-98 : Changes in how the mud handles plus skill equipment.  Player
           favorable in that bonus learning is not limited to your
           potential learning in a discipline.
12-19-98 : Corrected an error in how high level (L40+) mob xp was being
           calculated (they now give more).  This has caused a corresponding
           adjustment in the xp to level for L40+.  Sorry for the
           inconvenience...
12-18-98 : More mob AI changes.  Tread carefully.
12-18-98 : COMBAT TWEAK : modifiers on combat hitting percentage put back in.
           These include: attack mode, chivalry, cintai, generic monk bonus,
           offense skill, defense skill, dexterity as tohit modifier,
           tohit, blindfighting.
12-17-98 : Executing a backstab without a target will now check for any
           group member, in the order listed by group, that is in a fight
           and will backstab their target.
12-16-98 : Combined the 3 Ranger walk skills into a single skilled called
           hiking.  It contains the same properties as the old skills and
           should start with what your knowledge was of swamp walk.
12-16-98 : Equipment tweak : After looking at equipment again and seeing
           what people are wearing (and why), armor has undergone another
           price change.  It is STILL pricing the armor/struct of the
           equipment the same, however it does reevaluate things like
           magic effects, class wearability.
           Normally, we wouldn't grandfather such a change but since this
           change has REDUCED the armor's cost, and it seemed silly to
           clutter The World with overpriced gear, stuff saved offline
           (i.e. in rent) was also converted.  Just to be sure, your
           armor now has the better (lower) of the item's new price
           and the price of the equipment when you rented it.
12-16-98 : Barkskin's armor effect reduced.
12-16-98 : Chance of a combat blow crit fail has decreased.
12-16-98 : Adjusted picklock time to complete.  Pulses now occur more often.
12-15-98 : Beefed up mob AI a little bit, especially clerics.  Be wary.
12-15-98 : Fixed "prompt color piety" to work.  Note that mana and piety
           arguments are still synonomous.
12-15-98 : SneezyMAIL messages will now only remain deliverable for 30 days.
           After that time, they get deleted.
12-15-98 : Fixed a problem where everyone was hitting too often.  Even matches
           were having about 85% hit rates instead of the desired 60%.
12-15-98 : Problem where "You have gained enough to be a L51 warrior." fixed.
12-15-98 : If you can't see who told you something, you won't be able to
           reply to them.  Too many complaints so we'll go with realism over
           convienience.
12-14-98 : Thives with a small learning in evaluate will now be able to
           determine if a pierce weapon is small enough to use with backstab
           and stab.
12-14-98 : Took the randomness out of considering yourself.  Should actually
           be a little useful now.
12-14-98 : Added the ability to consider yourself.  Should help in choosing
           armor for yourself.
12-14-98 : Yet another Combat Damage tweak.  My previous tweak still
           had PCs hitting too softly (theoretically) so players are hitting
           about 20% harder now.  Continue to praise my name.  :)
12-14-98 : Some preliminary changes in various characteristic related
           functions.  I sincerely doubt you will even notice any change
           from this, but I'll put it in for completeness.  (Under the
           hood stuff, strictly).
12-14-98 : Kneestrike now verifies that you actually have legs.  :)
12-14-98 : Consider will now factor in armor spells/prayers when stating
           level difference now.
12-14-98 : Shops will slowly repair their inventory to avoid tons of
           beat up second hand gear.
12-14-98 : Some minor tweaks to STR and DEX contributions to damage per hit.
12-13-98 : XP TWEAK AND CONVERT : Once again, we've modified the XP system and
           tried to preserve the best of both of the last two systems.  It
           continues to be founded on the double difficulty=double xp
           but is also a much lower scale (125 mill to L50).  For the
           record, the last scale was based on experimentation with what
           mobs were twice as powerful, while the new scale is based on
           the theoretical difficulty doubling.  The last couple of
           combat tweaks obsoleted the experimental scale anyway...
           Oh, BTW, it is still a decimal number under the hood, but will
           reveal itself as an integer number as much as possible since
           that was what people preferred.
           And just cuz someone will ask, the overall difficulty of the
           mud has remained the same (same number of kills per level). 
12-12-98 : COMBAT TWEAK : The formula used to determine if you hit or not
           has been ripped out and replaced (removing the 12-06 tweak in
           the process).  For the time being, the replacement is a VERY
           SIMPLISTIC level vs AC calculation ignoring other factors (attack
           mode, position, etc, etc).  Once the basics are verified to
           be working properly, those other factors will reenter.
12-11-98 : Two more free deaths have been added to help cope with the damage
           change.
12-11-98 : DAMAGE TWEAK : Formula used to yield the damage done per hit
           has changed.  The old formula gave mobs a bit extra more than
           they were supposed to have, and had players at about 65% of what
           they should be doing.  In plainer terms, mobs now do less, players
           do more.
12-09-98 : MOB XP TWEAK : Efforts have begun to balance non-warrior classes
           for mobs with the warrior baseline.  Thus far, mage, cleric and
           deikhan are complete, while other classes are still rough
           estimates.  This should address some of the mobX is much tougher
           than mobY but they both give the same XP complaints.
12-09-98 : The spells command now shows the number of component charges you
           have available for each spell.
12-09-98 : Yet more refinements of the XP loss on fleeing.  It has basically
           been toned way down for the duration of the changes and will be
           cranked back up once things are more stable (probably never to be
           as bad as it was before).
12-08-98 : Some further refinements of flee XP loss in place.
12-08-98 : Fixed problem with Famine causing drink containers to lose
           liquid, but remain the same weight.
12-08-98 : Fixed a problem where spell effects would double for renting a
           pet out and in.
12-08-98 : Effect durations displayed under "att con", etc have lost their
           randomness.  They continue to be approximations, but they won't
           fluxuate with each use.
12-08-98 : GOLD TWEAK : Mob's wealth is now derived based on their level
           rather than being set arbitrarily by the builders.  This should
           provide a small degree of randomization of wealth, but is not
           intended to significantly change the economy. 
12-07-98 : RENT TWEAK : The formula used to establish armor's price/rent has
           been tweaked slightly.  The new formula ties the EQ's armor/struct
           to a "level" deemed appropriate, and then uses that level in
           combination with the current rent credit system to insure proper
           pricing.  I did not notice significant changes occuring but am
           happier with how the new formula works in relationship to the
           overall gaming system.
12-06-98 : Kneestrike was doing excessive damage if it was advancely learned.
           This was unintentional and has been fixed.
12-06-98 : Some improvements in the mob logic for picking combat skills to use.
12-06-98 : COMBAT TWEAK : a temporary hack is in place for PC/mob combat.
           It is basically meant to attenuate the problems where PCs are
           grossly out of line with their mob counterparts.  This is necessary
           as the new XP system would otherwise allow for small imbalances
           in power to be translated as rapid advances in XP.
12-04-98 : XP is now a decimal number.  This should give the newbie mobs
           much finer resolution and avoid many of the problems folks
           were complaining about.
12-04-98 : Player files were reverted to standpoint of 12/03 4PM EST.
           Any changes since that point have been lost.
           XP was reconverted for above change.
12-04-98 : XP for dropping things at dump has been changed to address latest
           XP changes.
12-04-98 : Flee XP loss tweaked again, now 1/128 of mob's xp if mob is
           higher level, otherwise 1/32 of mob's xp.
12-04-98 : Ranger level 7 and level 14 quests are in. The 7th level quest
           has been tested a good deal, the level 14 may still have bugs.
           Please see Mithros if you want to be set to test either quest
           before you gain again, otherwise it will be set once you gain.  
           Please report any bugs/typos to Mithros.
12-03-98 : Arena deaths no longer use up free deaths.
12-03-98 : Fleeing XP loss corrected to address latest change.
12-03-98 : Exp Tweak : The formula used to calculate how much xp a mob
           has has been significantly altered.  Please See HELP EXPTWEAK
           for complete details.
12-03-98 : Existing player files have had their XP converted to the
           new system.
11-29-98 : Fixed a problem allowing items to go over max.
11-25-98 : Combat Tweak : The formula that determines chance of hitting has
           changed.  Previously, an even fight was resulting in 70% chance
           of hitting through L10, then it jumped to about 95% for all levels
           over L15.  Obviously, if you are well decked out armor-wise and
           are still being hit 95% of the time, why wear armor?
           The fix puts the new hit% rate around 60% for all equal fights.
           This hopefully gives armor a more important role.
11-25-98 : Free deaths are now active.
11-25-98 : Feathery descent will now decrease damage taken as well as allow
           you to fall further without dying.
11-24-98 : A "free deaths" line is viewable under "att con".  Free deaths
           will start to be used once combat changes begin.

*************
11-24-98 : HELP FUTURE RELEASE contains important information about the
           upcoming changes being contemplated.
*************

11-24-98 : Backed off recent Mob v. PC combat changes to fix some
           problems introduced. 
11-23-98 : High level mobs no longer automatically avoid bash, however the
           penalties they suffer from being bashed have been reduced.
11-22-98 : Took out component merge code until it can be rewritten
11-21-98 : Corrections to xp formula made.  Primary effect was to better
           evaluate newbie mobs.  Also tweaked flight modifier to XP too.
11-20-98 : Ranged combat no longer sets you "fighting" momentarily.
11-20-98 : Enhanced warrior mob combat AI.  Only new addition is use of
           kneestrike skill.  They should pick the skill to use a bit
           more effectively now though.
11-19-98 : The way spell effects are shown has been redone.  When looking
           in a room, only "important" effects will be shown, eg flight,
           sanctuary, blindness etc.  The more mundane effects will be
           compressed into a one line description.  With brief mode on, no
           effects will be shown.  Looking and glancing shows all effects,
           as usual.
11-19-98 : Fixed bug in TOGGLE LIMBS that showed the wrong information
11-19-98 : Duplicate components put into containers will merge to cut
           down on component spam.
11-18-98 : Flight spell duration has a weight correction in it now.
11-18-98 : Talens will have weight/volume if stored as objects.
11-18-98 : Guildmasters and Trainers taken off protector and assist codes so 
           will be safer to fight around. 
11-17-98 : Some shuffling of learning start/rate for spells in water disc.
11-17-98 : Tracked down a few more remnants of the faction% code and
           eliminated problems related to them.
11-17-98 : Variability of damage for headbutt, stomp and bodyslam also
           reduced.  Same mean, more consistent!
11-17-98 : The harm spells formula have changed.  The mean damage has remained
           the same, but the standard deviation has been reduced.  That is,
           its effect is much more consistent.
11-17-98 : New Spell: PLASMA MIRROR!    See help for details.
11-16-98 : Changes made to the age-based modification to stats to make them
           more linear rather than big drops/gains at critical ages.
11-16-98 : A problem introduced into the stat system on 11-13 fixed.
           Skills that relie on stats should be back to normal.
11-14-98 : Holy Water vials now fall under partial consumption rent rules
11-13-98 : A first attempt at balancing mob and PC combat strengths is in
           place.  It is a rough approximation, but should make things easier
           at low level, and also attenuate the runaway growth at high levels.
           We fully expect to have further refinements and adjustments made.
11-13-98 : Disregard the change below.  High con races will be offset with
           other penalties yet to be determined.
11-13-98 : Due to evident imbalances between races, the HP modifier awarded on
           gaining has been switched from natural-consititution to chosen con.
           This will only affect future gaining attempts.
11-13-98 : Limb damage was dual crediting the CON characteristic.  Once
           to totally avoid limb damage, and once to reduce damage.  This
           second check has been removed.
11-12-98 : Bash will have reduced effectiveness against mobs of high level.
11-12-98 : Combat penalties for fighting on the ground reduced.  Formerly
           your attack and defend rolls were roughly 5-8 levels lower, and
           damage incurred would be 60-100% higher.  You will now fight at
           a 1-2 level penalty and take 10-30% more damage per hit.
11-12-98 : Shops fixed to deal with 300+ items in list.
11-11-98 : Piety regen and cleric success rate corrected for removal of 
           faction%.
11-11-98 : New auto toggle LIMBS to show tank limb condition after every fight
11-10-98 : Some fine tuning of the XP formulas done.
11-10-98 : First mage quest (magician's belt) should now be working.  Bug
           any problems.
11-10-98 : Faction percent has been removed pending full implementation of
           factions.
11-10-98 : Spell effects on creatures only reveal themselves on a look-at now,
           rather than spamming the room description.
11-10-98 : Problem with very high levels bashing very low levels fixed.
11-09-98 : Self and Me are now valid argument for all commands
11-09-98 : Cleric mobs will now have a chance to load holy water.
11-09-98 : New monk skill 'catfall'.
11-09-98 : Jirin is now learn by doing.  I'm not sure how this one slipped
           past me for so long, my apologies.
11-09-98 : A miracle happened and overnight, Hobbits got smarter.
           Hobbits with levels greater than 4 can get a one-time
           practice addition by seeing Cosmo or Peel.
11-08-98 : Sorcerer's globe effects greatly increased if cast on self.
11-08-98 : Critical success for sorcerer's globe spell and armor prayer
           when cast on others now ONLY increase duration, not the amount
           of AC any more.
11-07-98 : Crit Fail chance added to feign death skill (extremely rare)
11-07-98 : Different Villages and communities around the Realm seem to be
           finding an increased awareness for protecting their own
           citizens and children.  This is basically code that has
           been in for some time which is now being applied to some 
           older zones.
11-07-98 : Protection spells now protect equipment from damage as well
11-05-98 : Ice Storm and flaming sword messages fixed.
11-05-98 : Mob exp formula altered based on improved logic about how mob's
           stats affect its difficulty.  Hopefully harder mobs have more XP
           than easier ones.
           A mob's level is also being corrected now for its stats so that
           consider's level accuracy is more precise.
           Fine tuning of this change is expected to be needed (but only
           major tweaks will be reported).
11-03-98 : Barkskin renewable messaging and logic fixed. Barkskin will
           now take the component charge.
10-31-98 : A hard disk problem caused some player file corruptions if
           you were online.  Most people had reimbursements done already
           If you were on line and had problems that were not taken
           care of, find a god.
10-29-98 : Ranger components no longer need to be held if a ranger is
           not fighting.  If the ranger is fighting, he will need to
           hold the component to use the component.
10-28-98 : Ranger skills totally seperated from casting.  Some of them
           responded to direct commands and to cast command.
10-27-98 : More tweaks to HP regen, previous rate worked properly at high
           levels, but amounted to WAY too much for newbies.
10-27-98 : Mobs wielding 2H weapons no longer get double attacks.
10-27-98 : Ranger mobs have some new spellbags.
10-26-98 : Brew components will load less frequently.  Rangers and mages
           will no longer load shaman components.
10-24-98 : Added 'spells' command.  Read 'help spells' for details.
10-24-98 : Mage and ranger mobs will no longer load shaman components.
10-23-98 : Undead can no longer be garrotted since they don't breathe.
10-23-98 : Regen rates tweaked.  The intention was to take the max a L50
           would have, and roughly achieve that in 10 minutes (or so).
           i.e. zero to full in 10 minutes...
           Net changes: hp regen up 66%, mana regen up 100%, piety regen
           down 33%, move regen left alone.
10-20-98 : Minor deikhan shield bash problem fixed.
10-20-98 : The vast reaches of the Atakaji Desert are now open for 
           exploration by intrepid explorers.  Rumors tell of a vast temple
           deep in the desert, home to a great evil, and overflowing with

           for damage done vs damage received.
10-16-98 : More tweaks added to recent exp award change for killing below
           level.  Class is taken into account, and new numbers aren't
           quite so harsh.
10-16-98 : Monk barehand damage will peak a bit later than before.  Some of
           you may drop a damage level because of this.
10-16-98 : The monk skill jirin now includes blocking as well as dodging.
           This is a cosmetic change.

10-16-98 : The chi skill has been moved from Meditation/Internal Abilities to
           Monk Abilities.  The advanced uses of chi still depend primarily

           your level.

10-12-98 : Shop enhancements:
           - List fit in a component shop will show only comps for spells
             player knows

10-11-98 : - Focus now plays a bigger part in losing concentration in spells/
             prayers. 
           -  Engaging players will almost never lose concentration.
10-11-98 : The limbs command can now be used on other people.
10-11-98 : Attempting to make some very slight balance changes 
           - Made low dex have bigger effects in secondary hand hits/misses

             and lowered hp gain for high con races. 
           - Lowered exp on certain mob races slightly.
10-09-98 : Numerous pierce weapons modified.  Damages and weights now
           more in line with those of slash and blunt.  2-handed pierce
           weapons now much better than one handed.
10-08-98 : Added some color to combat at request of many players.
10-08-98 : Some changes to drop. You can now drop x.item and have it
           find held items.  Thus you can now drop a held lantern when
           you have a lantern in inventory.  The order is inventory
           then equipment so the held lantern will be 2.lantern.
10-08-98 : Some light changes to object parsing/numbering. This change
           should fix the problem where you got things from a bag when you
           were both holding a bag and had one in inventory.  If the change
           results in any wierd manipulations, please bug them.
10-07-98 : Mobs aggroing due to racial hatreds are a bit more clear about
           why they are attacking.

10-03-98 : Repo mobs will now purge themselves after a successful repo
10-03-98 : Arenas no longer heal limbs upon death
10-03-98 : Changed around free mage component loads. They are no longer cursed 
           so can be dropped/put into bags. They will be personalized for the
           mage though, and unusable by other mages. Also the trainer now just
           loads one component per spell, with a bunch of charges
10-02-98 : Some modifications made to skinning.  More pulses were added
           to actually skin the animal, but each pulse is shorter.
           Old skinning knives are probably unsuited to the system.
           Please do not ask about reimbursement.

           implemented more fully is now on learn from doing.

               2) Focus stat helps deter critical failures
               3) Critical Failure can no longer kill a mage (will take to 1-10 hp)
             II) Trainers will give you components when you first learn a spell
                 that needs components.

           into fights.

09-22-98 : Changes to springleap:
             When springleap is done automatically, it will work no matter
               how crowded the room is and it will not lag.
             Springleap can be called manually at any time, but it is
               restricted by crowding and it will lag.
09-22-98 : Fixed a bug with weapon specialization skills.  If you have a 
           specialization, you may notice a decrease in the bonus it gives
           if you don't already have the skill maxed or very high.
09-21-98 : Full Heal spell fixed
09-21-98 : Lag for a rescuee reduced to one combat round.

09-19-98 : Stunned mobs will not cause charge failures because of crowding.
09-19-98 : Changes to Cudgel:
             Cudgelled mobs will now hate the cudgeler on a success.  
             Success rate for cudgelling an already fighting mob reduced
                   Rate for stationary (not fighting) mobs not changed
             Length of time a mob won't hit back greatly reduced.
             Successful cudgel will end a victims cast.

09-16-98 : The scribe spell ink components will no longer load, until the
           scribe skill is implemented.

09-10-98 : Activated two new shops in Kalysia, the long non-functional
           weapons shop and one other.
09-09-98 : Racial metabolism factored into consumption.  You may find you
           have to eat more/less now to get full.
09-09-98 : Body mass now factored into drunkenness formulas
09-04-98 : Reconnected second (Rough Road) entrance to Malithean Mines. 
09-03-98 : All quest mobs will try to drop items if they are unable
           to give them to you. It is still possible that there maybe
           some cases where a quest mob will not give or drop the item 
           but I can't think of any offhand and it is probably a sign
           that a quest is broken. Only bug if the mob actually says
           he is trying to drop.
09-03-98 : Players and Mobs will show up as casting when you look 
           in a room and they actually are casting (of course).

           even if tanking if you are not barred by other reasons
09-03-98 : Accumulation of bar hoppers in taverns fixed.
09-02-98 : "gtell" will work for group telling.  Before only "gt" would work.
09-01-98 : Enough discussion, fixed the mana/piety help disparities up. Found
           that it wasn't even working right.  You will not be able to
           start the cast/prayer without the full complement of mana/piety
           now rather than just the per-round amount. However, help files
           are correct and the amount needed to start the cast is the
           actual amount taken in the cast.
09-01-98 : Clerics can no longer continue their prayers when their piety
           will not support the extra rounds. 
09-01-98 : Deleted some old exits from the Malithean Mines that were left
           from 4.x.  There is only 1 entrance/exit to this zone at the
           moment, others are awaiting completion of new areas.
09-01-98 : New version of the Herald (Issue 4).
08-31-98 : Movement on multi-ridden mounts fixed.
08-31-98 : Checks for too many followers now factor in charisma and level.
08-31-98 : Some improvements to sleeptag zone.  Players will not use moves
           or get hungry.  No more sleeping all players in the control room
           by accident and the game can be played within a group and have
           the staff work.
08-31-98 : Cast rounds in heal serious brought in line with other heals.
08-31-98 : Combat initiative is now calculated based on the speed
           characteristic.

08-29-98 : Some of the healing messages colorized and returns added.
08-28-98 : Afk command fixed.
08-28-98 : A few mage spells learning curves changed. Mostly upper level
           ones so shouldnt affect anyone on now.
08-26-98 : AutoSuccess bug in charge fixed.  Not sure it was in the mud
           long (2 weeks), so probably doesn't constitute a change to the 
           way it works for some of you.  However, its a whopper. :).
           Two slight changes however,  Charge and layhands now subject
           to the general faction percentage affect for deikhan skills
           (it is a small one but wasn't applyed to these two skills).
           Also, Charging a stunned creature will now be auto success.
08-26-98 : Newbie Helper (social worker) will help clerics with symbols 
           and all players with weapons a little more often. Deikhans
           will still need the original time to get new donated symbols.
08-26-98 : Invis object spell put on tasking and component fixed.
08-26-98 : Thanks to Mithros for a new login screen.
08-26-98 : HP regeneration rate cut slightly to tone back a boost from
           late v4.5 that went a bit too far.

Syntax: use <object> {target}

Use is used to activate special <objects>.  Some <objects> need to be
used on a {target}.  Use generally requires the <object> be held, often
in the primary hand.

The most commonly used <objects> are staffs and wands.  Typically, used
<objects> have a number of charges (uses) that once used up may cause
some effect of the <object>.

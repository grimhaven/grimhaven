The Hi-Lo table is located in the casino.  You must sit at the
Hi-Lo table to start.  You must place a bet to get the cards dealt.
Syntax: BET <chip>

The object of Hi-Lo is to guess whether the next card drawn will be higher
or lower than the current card.  The more guesses you get in a row, the more
money you win.  Any wrong guess means you lose your entire winnings up to
that point.  The percentage you win doubles with each correct guess.
Once a card has been drawn, use the bet command to bet whether the next card
will be higher or lower.
Syntax: BET hi
Syntax: BET lo

Anytime after the first hi/lo bet, you may stay to take your current
winnings.  You will be paid out and the game will reset.
Syntax: STAY

Syntax: exits
Syntax: exit <portal>

The exits command will display all available exits from your location.
Realize that it only lists exits accessible at that time, so if a door
is closed, it is not accessible and hence not listed.

Exit with a parameter allows you to leave via a portal, gateway or other
non-standard exit that is in the room.

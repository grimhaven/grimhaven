Syntax: toggle noshout

The noshout toggle will allow you to play without hearing shouts 
or telepathic messages.  At the same time, you will be prevented 
from shouting.

Toggling noshout off will restore shout ability and display other
shouts to you.  You can not prevent shouts from gods (52+) from
displaying, although if a god's shout is annoying you, a friendly tell
to them will usually bring relief.

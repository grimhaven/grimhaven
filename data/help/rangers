Rangers are a warrior subclass.  Rangers are those individuals that have 
grown up in the wilderness and have become accustomed to both its dangers
and its gifts.  Ranger's forego some of the advanced teachings that true
warriors can receive in order to hone their special abilities and become
one with the nature around them.

Rangers are born hunters, and their long association with woodland creatures
gives them not only excessive knowledge of such creatures but also a limited
ability to control (supplemented with natural magic) them. Accustomed to the
wide open spaces, their weapon of choice is the bow.  Rangers are the only
class capable of specializing in ranged combat.

Rangers have developed limited natural magic by which they accomplish some
of the tasks that make this class unique.  While this magic is in no way
of a caliber with a true sorcerer in that it does not involve casting, it
does enable them to achieve somewhat more than would otherwise be
expected.  Most of these natural magics require a component.

Because of their magical background, Rangers shun the use of
metal armor.  Most ranger magics are ineffective when they are not in
natural in conditions that will accommodate that magic.  These conditions
may vary but generally are outdoor areas that are not part of a city. 
Most roads will also be not considered part of nature even if the area
surrounding the road is natural.

Rangers have the following basic disciplines:  Combat, Ranger Abilities,
Adventuring, Ranged Specialization, Pierce Specialization, Slash
Specialization. 

Rangers have the following specialized skill disciplines:
Fighting Skills, Plant Abilities, Animal Skills, Survival Skills

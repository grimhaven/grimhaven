Syntax: wield <weapon> {left | right}

When you get tired of bashing monsters with your fists, you might consider
wielding a weapon.  It is much more effective to wield a weapon in your
primary hand.  Wield will automatically try to put the item in your primary
hand, if possible.  The slot must be working and free if {slot} is specified.
Both slots must be available if <weapon> is two-handed.  Wielding can add
command lock out and add periods where the wielder can't hit.

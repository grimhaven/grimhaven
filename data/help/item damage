Items that are subjected to the stresses and strains associated with
battle will eventually show signs of wear and tear.  In general, the
item will have its condition listed in parenthesis when it is listed.
Not all (brand new) items are of the same quality.  Obviously, platemail
is going to be more rugged than tinmail armor.  Additionally, once an item
begins to deteriorate, the chance of it deteriorating further is increased.
Item damage of this type can be repaired in a variety of ways.  The most
common is to give it to one of the various repair shops located around and
they will fix it for you for a price.  Certain skills will also fix items.

Weapons accrue two forms of damage, the first being structural damage,
described above.  The second being a loss of quality.  A weapon's
quality can be thought of as how sharp the blade is - how pointy the
tip or how smooth the surface area.  Loss of quality is what happens
as a blade dulls or chips.  The lower the quality, the less damage the
weapon is likely to do, and the less likely the chance of a critical
blow.  You will have to examine the weapon to see the quality.  Certain
skills may fix item quality.

Do not confuse quality with condition.  The former is fixable at cutlery
shops, while the latter is represented in parenthesis and is fixable at
repair shops.

Syntax: makeleader <person> <leader slot #>

Makeleader is used by faction leaders to alter current leader settings for
a faction.  You can only set leadership in your own faction, and can not
adjust leadership above you (lower in number).  i.e.  Leader #2 can not set
leader #1, but can set either leader #2 or #3.

The advantage of leadership is that certain capabilities are restricted to the
faction's leadership.

<person> must be a currently registered PC, or "noone" if you wish to leave
the slot vacant.  <leader slot #> is a value from 0 to 3.

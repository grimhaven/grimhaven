Skills and spells are learned in two ways.  First, one is taught a
skill by a trainer.  This provides the theoretical knowledge that you 
as a player could have.  However, as in life, you do not really know
some things until you use them.

Not everything requires that you use them, but most of the skills and
spells do. Whether something is learned by doing will show up in the help
file of the skill.

If it is not learned by doing, your learning of the skill will be what the
trainer teaches you.

If it is learned by doing, your learning will start at a constant number
and increase from there naturally with use.  There are time components in
the skill learning to prevent power leveling skills by kicking mice over
and over.  Wisdom directly affects your learning rates.

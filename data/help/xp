Experience points are awarded each time you damage a creature.  The amount
of experience a given monster has is a function based on how well it hits,
how well it is armored, and how long it is likely to last in combat, as
well as whether it has any special abilities.  In general, two mobs of
equivalent difficulty will award the same exp.  If you do 1% damage to a
monster in battle, you receive 1% of its exp.  If you are grouped, that 1%
of the exp is split over the group according to a number of formula. (See
help file on Formulas). 

Additionally, you only receive your "share" of the experience divided by the
number of classes that you are.  i.e.  double class get half, triple receive 
one third.

It is important to note that exp is awarded for directly damaging a
creature's main hit points.  Since damage to limbs only does a small
amount of damage to a creature's main hit points, limb damage yields
small amounts of xp.  Also, indirect or time-delay damage (bleeding,
starving, suffocating, etc) will yield no exp although some ranged 
attacks will.

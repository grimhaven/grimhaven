Syntax: rituals <offensive|utility> <targeted|nontargeted> <all>

The rituals command allows you to view your rituals by category.  The targeted/
nontargeted options refer to whether or not the ritual targets an individual
person.  Rituals that target objects are considered to be nontargeted.  The all
option shows all the spells of a particular type, whether or not you have
learned them yet.

Each line lists the spell name, your current learnedness of the ritual, your
max learnedness of the ritual, the number of component charges for the spell
that you have available and the name of the required component.

Usage examples:

rituals offensive
rituals offensive targeted
rituals utility nontargeted all

Faction Leaders are the political heads of their respective factions.  They
are responsible for maintaining the various rules and bylaws of the faction,
promoting the beliefs of the faction, and handling membership of the faction.

To that end, they have special commands which are only available to faction
leaders.  Not all commands are usable by all leaders, some require a higher
degree of authority.

Faction Leader Commands:
ADJUST		MAKELEADER	NEWMEMBER	RMEMBER		SEND

Faction Leaders are NOT the <h> Immortals/Gods/Implementors.  Problems
regarding faction's policies or actions should be directed to the faction
leadership.  As with most actions amongst mortals, the gods will not interfere.

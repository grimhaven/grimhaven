Magic is a fickle science that is controlled through the use of spells
and draws upon a person's mana for energy.  While much lore has been
written on the use and control of magic, few profess to understand
what magic in and of itself is.  In fact, raw magic in its unadulterated
form is seldom seen on The World, although it is thought that it was
once much more plentiful.

The rules of magic are obtuse except to the practitioners of the art.
What is common knowledge is that it can either be summoned forth directly
by a spell caster, or installed latently into an item of magic, the most 
common of which are wands, potions, scrolls and staffs.

While theoretically anything is possible through magic, the conservation of
thaumaturgy principle places a practical limitation that requires any magical
action to be paid for in mana.  The greater the magical disruption, the greater
the mana cost.  The upshot of this is that it is often more practical to
attempt a feat by actually doing it than to attempt to cause it via magic.
This is why magic has not put every other profession out of business.

Syntax: disband

Disband is used to remove yourself from your present faction.  Obviously, you
must presently be a member in a faction for this to work.

You must be a member in a faction to disband, i.e., you can not disband from
"Unaffiliated".  Disbanding will return your faction allegiance to 
"Unaffiliated" and reset faction percentages to 0.00%.

If you accidentally disband yourself, only a faction's leadership can reassign
you to the faction.  Please do not ask gods to do this for you.

To prevent from being admitted to a faction, set your autojoin bit off.

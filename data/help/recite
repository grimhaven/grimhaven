Syntax: recite <scroll> {target}
        recite <scroll> me
        recite <scroll> self
        recite <scroll> tank

Recite is used to "read" a magic <scroll>.  If {target} is ignored, the default
target will be your combat opponent, if you have one.  You may explicitly
indicate an object or character as the {target} of the <scroll>.

When you are grouped with someone in a fight you can use "tank" as the target
name to auto-select whomever your enemy is bashing away at.

Recite requires that you possess the ability to read magic.

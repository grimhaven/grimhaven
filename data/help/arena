	Arena combat is a player versus player environment. Killing in these
types of areas do not assign any player age or experience penalty for death.
Special rooms for arena combat are marked and obvious. These areas are meant 
be strictly for fun and enjoyment.

	The arena does not take away your responsibility for killing. Along 
with this is is still possible to loot another players corpse. Before engaging
in arena combat, be sure you have a good idea of how you will fighting with
your opponent.

Reimbursements for arena battle will NOT be issued. Be careful in what you
do in arena combat.

Look for <r>[ARENA]<z> in the room to identify the arena.

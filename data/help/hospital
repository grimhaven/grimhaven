While clerics are quite adept at healing many types of ailments,
there are a few problems that only a specialist can fix.  These
specialists can usually be found in the various hospitals around the
land.  Hospitals are sanctuaries found in major places of civilization
that are adept at healing both the body as well as curing ailments
of the limbs, or extracting various diseases.

Examination rooms will heal hit points at an accelerated rate, although
there is a per hitpoint charge for the use of these facilities.

The emergency room will allow you to receive full restoration of hit
points, but for a high price.

Additionally, there is typically some sort of medic who can diagnose and
cure most major ailments.

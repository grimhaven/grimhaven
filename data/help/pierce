Pierce weapons are small edged blades.  Daggers, knives, switchblades and
pins are good examples.  Any weapon that: PIERCES, STABS, SPEARS, THRUSTS
or STINGS is a pierce style weapon.  Only pierce style weapons may be used
for backstabbing.

Pierce weapons are roughly equally good against hard or soft target.
A good many creatures are of such dense material that the blade is unable to
puncture their skin and they are essentially immune or resistant to pierce
style attacks.  Pierce weapons punch holes in metal armor about as easily as
they tear apart softer leather, making them a good balance between blunt and
slash if you don't mind that the small size gives them a necessarily smaller
amount of damage.

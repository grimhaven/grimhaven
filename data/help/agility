Agility represents a character's body control, and how graceful they are.

In game terms, agility governs one's armor class and defensive bonuses.
If you are extremely agile, you will be very hard to hit.  Also, agility
may contribute to various skills.  It will be a lot easier for you to
triple kick a victim with high agility than if you are clumsy.

Note that agility is the tradeoff with brawn.  A brawny person can wear
very heavy armor and absorb damage, but he will not be able to dodge a lot
of attacks.  However, the agile person won't need as much armor, for they
are able to avoid most of the damage.

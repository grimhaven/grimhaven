Unlock pretty much does what it says, it unlocks something.
Syntax: unlock <something>

The item must be locked and you must possess the proper key to unlock
the item.  It is appropriate to use this on a wide variety of things: chests,
doors, portals, gates, desks, etc.  Unlocking a trapped item may cause the
trap to go off.

If the item is an object of some sort, you may use standard referencing
format to differentiate multiple, similar objects.
eg.
unlock 1.chest		unlock chest large
unlock 2.chest 		unlock chest small
unlock 3.chest 		unlock 2.chest small

Exits may be differentiated by doing:
unlock door north 	unlock door wooden 
unlock door east	unlock door steel
unlock door sw		unlock door large

Unlock will try and determine what you mean if you give it an ambiguous target.
That is, it will attempt to unlock the first <something> that is locked that
it can find.

Syntax: history

The history command will list out all the commands in your history. Your
history is composed of the 10 most recent commands you have entered. History
is useful in conjunction with the shell capability of the mud.

The most useful feature of the history command is the ability to redo a 
previous command.  This is done via !<num> where <num> is the number of the
command from your history.

Charisma is a special quality of personal magnetism and charm.  It is an
important quality when you want to be a leader.

In game terms, charisma will govern you control over your pets.  A very
charismatic person will have great control over pets and they will more
willingly follow their master.  However, an uncharismatic character
will have a tough time getting their pet to do anything and they will
more likely rebel against their master due to hatred towards them.

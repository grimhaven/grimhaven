Syntax: mount <mount>
Syntax: ride <mount>

The mount and ride commands are synonymous and allow the adventurer
to mount a horse or similar mount for riding.

Riding creatures takes a fair amount of skill both to merely stay
atop them as well as to induce them to travel in the desired direction.
Failed attempts generally lead to falling flat on your face, and can
also cause the mount to become enraged.  A good deal of trial and error
is to be expected.

Certain skills are not possible from the mounted position.  Additionally,
being mounted significantly raises the level of your head, which while
advantageous for vision makes you a much more visible to your foes and
can be a problem if the ceilings are low.

Mounts can be induced to follow very basic orders from their master,
however they have no special affinity to their rider and will flee
quite readily from a life threatening situation, generally dislodging
their rider abruptly.

It is not possible to mount a creature that is higher level than you. It
is very difficult to mount a creature that is involved in a fight but its
not impossible. Karma plays a certain role in determining ride success.

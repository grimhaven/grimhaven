Syntax: hit <creature>

A good way to start a fight.  You will be unable to attack certain
creatures (immortals, deities, etc.)  Hit will also allow you to hit after
being engaged.

You will be able to switch your status back and forth between 1) 
disengaged, 2) engaged, and 3) hitting by the use of the commands "hit",  
"engage" and "disengage".  If you are engaged, you can start physically
attacking by typing hit <target>.  If you are hitting, you can stop 
hitting (but still be in the fight) by the use of "engage" or "disengage"
and you can disengage totally from the fight from engaged status with
"disengage".  You can not fully disengage from a fight if you are tanking.


Syntax: hit

Hit also is used at the blackjack table to take an additional card.

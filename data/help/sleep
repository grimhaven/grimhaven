Syntax: sleep {object}

Sleep causes you to stretch yourself and lose consciousness.  Sleeping
provides the best regeneration possible, but the risk is that you are
completely unaware of your surroundings.  It is generally advisable to
only sleep somewhere you feel perfectly safe.

Various objects can be slept on.  These objects will increase your
regeneration even further as they provide a comfortable place to sleep.
Obviously, the object must be big enough to sleep on, as you can't stretch
out and get comfortable on just anything.  Also, objects designed for
small creatures may prove to be a bit too uncomfortable to provide any
benefit.

To stop sleeping, merely wake up.

<R>WARNING:<z> Sleeping can be detrimental to the liforce of a Shaman.

As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
by your racial selection.  Territorial selection serves as a modifier
on these natural stats.  So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race
here that will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm. 

Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
game.  However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly
by your choice of background.  The chief effect of territorial
choice is to modify your natural racial stats.

Lounge Troglodyte: You come from a clan of troglodytes who mainly inhabit
shallow burrows or caves.  Often referred to as 'lazy', lounge troglodytes
are otherwise wise and educated; at least as much as possible for a
troglodyte.

Cavern Troglodyte: You were raised after hatching in the large cavernous
areas close to the surface of the known lands.  While far enough from the
surface to have escaped much attention, your clan still has an established
verbal tradition of education to impart.

Tunnel troglodyte: Living in the deeper areas of mountains and hills, you
spend much of your time repairing collapsed shafts and tunnels.  The labor
has made you strong and fit, although left little time for anything else.

Labyrinth troglodyte: You spent your entire life deep within the bowels of
the early.  Your clan is constantly digging to build defenses and
escapeways agianst the many preadators which inhabit the deep dark
underworld of the known realms.

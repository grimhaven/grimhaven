<h> help for choosing your class :

Class represents your character's profession.  It dictates what set of skills
are possible, as well as influences what your character can and can not do.
<h> strives to keep all classes balanced, however, that desired balance
may be that a given class is easier and more enjoyable to play at given levels
than others (usually balanced with a more difficult period as well).

One important suggestion, choose a class that appeals to you as opposed to one
you may have heard has a loophole that can be abused (in time, a loophole may be
removed).

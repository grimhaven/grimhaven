Your deities' potency represents the status of your faction in relation to
the other factions, as well as how powerful your deities are compared to
other faction's deities.  While it may seem like a trivial thing, it actually
can have profound effects on the members of the faction.

For instance, a potent faction will permit that faction's clerics to regenerate
piety at an accelerated rate.  Conversely, a below average power deity will not
regenerate the piety of followers.  Additionally, interventions (fate rescuing
from nasty effects) increase.

It is a foolhardy faction that allows their potency to drop too low.

Your deities' potency is related to the performance of all members of that
faction as well as the actions that have been performed against that faction.
For instance, as you do well (killing the enemies of the faction and aiding
your allies), you not only raise your faction percentage, but also raise your
deities' potency.  Similarly, potency will drop if you allow your faction
percentage to drop.  At the same time, helping another faction will raise the
potency of the helped faction, or lower it if they were harmed.  Realize though,
faction percentage is specific to you, while all members of a faction contribute
to the potency.

Potency is drained somewhat each time the deity interferes in the mortal
realm.  The most common way this happens is in the regeneration of piety
to that faction's clerics, but Miracles and the like also have their effect
on potency.

Rituals are a direct communication with various ancestors and gods 
sometimes refered to as "Loa". The Loa are fickle and are very demanding
upon the Shaman. While much has been passed from generation to generation
about the specific rituals of the spirits, few profess the understanding
what Shaman rituals are all about. The steps contained within the rituals
are obtuse except to the Hungan (see "help Hungan"). 

What is common knowledge to the Hungan, can either be summoned forth directly
by a Shaman, or installed latently into an item of magic, the most common of 
which are wands, potions, scrolls and staffs.

While these actions in future times will become trivial to the Hungan, the
practical limitations of the ritual requires an amount of life essence, or
lifeforce. The more power that is demanded upon the ancestors the greater
the demand is for the essence of life.

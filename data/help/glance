Syntax: glance <creature>

Glance is a useful command to look at a creature's condition without all
the needless spam of seeing its description and items worn.  Glance displays
condition as well as major wounds or diseases.

This is a useful command for use in the heat of battle for players with
slow modems, although the addition of "prompt opponent" has mostly
superseded it.

Major wishes are typically granted as the result of the completion of a
large, complex quest that spanned one or more evenings.  They are generally
for high level players and are of "lethal" difficulty where even slight 
miscalculations are likely to leave you dead and/or without any equipment.  
Major wishes can only be granted by the immortal who designed the quest and
with the aid of a 57+ god.  Typical major wishes might include:

--creation of a new item
  (such items tend to be unstable due to code limitations.  No guarantees made)
--extensive modification of an existing item
  (limited by power of wish.  No guarantees on permanency due to code)
--reduced rental cost on an item you already have.
  (generally it gets reduced by 1/2)
--modification of your person.
  (increased hit points, increased characteristics (str/wis/int...), age
  alteration)
--freedom from hunger or thirst (never need to eat or drink again)
--2 million exp or enough for next level (whichever is least)
--annulment of death(s).
  (# annulled limited by power of wish)
--creation of major wealth.
--some combination of minor/major wishes at the discretion of the immortal.

Quality of the wish is dependent on difficulty of the quest.  Wish 
phrasing is important... asking for a million coins might get you buried
alive under an avalanche of coins falling from the sky.  Asking for
things beyond the power of the wish might burn-out and use up the wish
making it useless.  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

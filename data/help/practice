The practice command can be used to view your available disciplines and
your current learning in them, to view skills within a discipline or to
learn more about a discipline from the appropriate trainer.  Additionally,
the practice command may be used to view your current learning in a skill
or to view all the available disciplines for a specific class.

Example: practice
This will display all your available disciplines, differentiate between
your basic disciplines, automatically learned disciplines and advanced
disciplines, as well as display any available practices you have.

Example: practice combat
This will display all the skills in the combat discipline, how well you
know them or when you might learn them and displays how many available 
practices you have.

Example: practice combat 3
If you are in the same room with the correct combat trainer and have the
available practices to spend, this will cause the combat trainer to
teach you more about the combat discipline. 

Example: practice skill kick
If you have the skill "kick," you will see your current proficiency and
potential for the skill.

Syntax: immortal

The immortal command will toggle your immortality on and off.  Note that
this command is designed to allow a builder to do a walk-through of their
area as mortal.  As such, not everything is "as a mortal", ie. you can
still do things like goto, load, etc.  But darkness, teleporters, doors
and the like are as-if-mortal.  Combat is also enabled while mortal, since
you could theoretically die, your gold is removed and restored as you move
in and out of immortal-mode.

NOTE: if you do die, please make sure you eliminate your corpse and any
equipment it may have had.  We don't need players looting god's corpses.

Immortality is turned back on automatically after dying or a reboot.

I don't want gods going around getting killed or attacked by players, do
not entice them to!

Tells you the location of a monster, a player or an object. Examples:
where torch
where dragon
where 4.ring       (gives you the container traceback so you can find
                    out WHO has that One Ring)

Where with no arguments will reveal the location of all players.
where -g will reveal the location of all immortals.
You may NOT abbreviate with where, its too easy to generate lag otherwise.

  Creatores have 2 other options with the command:
where owners <character>
where engraved <character>

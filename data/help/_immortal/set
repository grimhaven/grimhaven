Allows a high-level god to manipulate a pc or mobs stats.  Indiscriminate
use of this where mortals are concerned is a good way to get demoted.

NOTES:
mhit, mmana and mmove:
Fields are also affected by age.  All we can affect is the non-age related part of
these fields. Realize the <pc> will remove 1 extra point for each year over their
base-age they are.

wizpower:
Wizpowers can be toggled on and off by the number or by set. Available sets are:
  basic, rooms, mobs, objs, demi, quest, trust, allpowers
Please note that each set needs to be toggled on or off individually, as one set
does not include the powers of the other ones, except for the "allpower" set.

** need to check this info **
skill maximum: @set "skill maximum" <percent>
This will approximate learn by doing learning.  It will go through the PC's
skills and give percent of the current max-Learning or any boosts that should  be 
given to a pc.  Thus if a percent is 50 and the disc learning has max
at 80, this will set the learn by doing to 40.  If the spell is boosted
to 50, he will get the full 50

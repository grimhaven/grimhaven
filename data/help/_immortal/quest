syntax: quest <victim> <message>

Effectively, this will echo <message> to the room, and then move <victim>
to room 76 (quest storage room).  Its chief advantage is that you can
do an echo and a trans in one shot and don't get "disappears in a cloud
of smoke"

This is meant as a roleplaying command.  Let's say StupidPC whips out his
sword and starts fighting the king before the king can tell the quest group
the info he is supposed to.  This lets you do something like:

quest StupidPC the guardsmen jump StupidPC and tear him limb from limb for daring to attack the king.

The victim is put in a Hell-like room (can't do anything).  It is assumed that
whoever used the quest command will let them out, once time permits and after
doing something appropriate.  (in the above example, probably killing)

NOTE:
  If you use the quest command in mortal form you can use:
  quest <qnum> to get help on the qnum quest flag, should it exist.

A way to make The World a little cleaner.
Usage:
  purge                         To empty a room of monsters and objects.
  purge <character>             To remove a living thing. Kicks out a player.
  purge <object>                Figure this one out yourself.
  purge zone <zone #>           Purges all mobs in a zone and makes it inactive
  purge links                   See below             
  purge ldead

The purge command, when first gotten, will only permit you to purge specific
items (ie. no general "purge").

Purging a character that is actively playing is not a good idea.  It will
kill their link, push them out of the game, and drop stuff to ground.  Very
similar to if they had quit.  There is no xp lost from this, but mortals tend
to find it objectionable.

Purge links is an emergency scram command.  It will kick all players less than
50th level out of the game.  Probably used in conjunction with a wizlock...
Purge ldead will go thru all characters and eliminate the link deads including
the bodies of immortals that would normally bypass the timeout clock.

Purge zone will destroy all mobs (and associated items) from <zone #>.  You 
can get the zone numbers from show zones.  It also deactivates the zone.
Purge zone all will remove all mobs in all zones who's activity is less then
the maximum. (ie, all active, but idling zones).

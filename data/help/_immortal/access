Access command provides some generic data to be pulled up on a character that
is offline including last connection date and time as well as site.  This
command may also be used with discretion by 58+ gods to alter a player's
password or level.  If you change a L3+ character's password 
or who has 3 hours of playing time please post a note to the wiz board with
reasons why it was necessary.  It is not possible to change the password of
someone of higher level than yourself.  (so much for hacking Brutius with this
eh?) Access can only be done on a character that is not connected.

syntax:
  access <player name>                          - general info
  access <player name> passwd <new password>    - password changing
  access <player name> level <new level> <class>  - level changing

Accessing with parameters (passwd, level) is only possible for high level
gods.

Syntax: testfight <mob vnum> <mob vnum>

A truly cool, but resource intensive command.

Given two vnums, the mud will cause 1000 fights between the two to be
started.  The first vnum will hit the second vnum in all cases.  Also,
the two mobs will invoke the defensive routines prior to the fights starting.

Each fight is set up in a separate, closed room.  These rooms are created
from any free rooms between 0 and 30000.  DO NOT start fights if people
are rloading builder rooms.  Each room is created at the outset, and destroyed
when the fight is complete.  DO NOT GO AND WITNESS ANY OF THE FIGHTS, you will
be toasted as well.

DO NOT PURGE ANY FIGHTS, or statistics won't clean up properly.

When all fights are complete, statistics are returned.
Statistics are of the form: "left/total (percent%) (num)" for each mob
  For each win the mob has, 1 is added to "num" and "left" is incremented by
  the number of hp the mob had left.  "total" is incremented regardless of
  win/loss by the max number of HP the mob has.  "percent" is left/total as a
  percentage.

Obviously, it may take a few minutes for all fights to complete.  Just be
patient.  Starting all the fights takes a lot of resources, and the combat
processing is very intensive for this number of fights.  Use sensibly!!!

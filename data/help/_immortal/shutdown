Syntax: shutdown 
Syntax: shutdown abort
Syntax: shutdown <minutes>

Shuts the mud down.  Shutdown with no arguments will do an immediate shutdown.
Shutdown <minutes> will allow a delayed shutdown with global messages as the
time ticks down.  Shutdown abort can be used to cancel a delayed shutdown.

In general, <h> is on a rebooter so that if the mud is shutdown, it will
be brought back online as fast as a reboot can take place.

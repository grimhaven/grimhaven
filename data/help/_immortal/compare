Syntax: compare <mob1> <mob2>

This is a simplistic combat comparison utility for doing rough calculations
on two mobs.  It is intended for use on mobs, and if used on players will
probably return inaccurate results.

Compare will determine the hit rate of mob1 and mob2.  That is, how often
is mob1 able to hit mob2 and vice versa.  There is a degree of randomization
in this calculation.

It then goes on to display the average dam per round that mob1 and mob2 do.
That is, (avg_dam_per_hit + damroll) * number_attacks.

The modified dam per round is simply the average dam per round multiplied
by the hit rate.

It then goes on to divide mob2's HP by mob1's modified dam per round to
determine how many rounds it would take mob1 to kill mob2 (and vice versa).

Be advised that special attacks, special procedures and other considerations
are NOT brought into play in this calculation.  This is simply a first order
approximation.

Deathcheck is useful to determine the validity of a player's statements
in a reimbursement situation.  This command will show when a player died
and what killed it.  Note, you will have to check through a number of logs
in most cases.

format: DEATHCHECK [player name] [log name]

note: capitalization of the player's name is important

EXAMPLES:

To see if Kalvrik died since the last reboot, you would use:

H:32016 R:1000>deathcheck Kalvrik current
Tue May 11 08:04:46 1993 :: Kalvrik killed by a goblin at Hallway

To see if Upset died on 5/11/93 during a particular 'uptime'
(in this case, the time right before the 7:09 reboot/crash)

H:32016 R:1000> deathcheck Upset 051193.0709
Your search-string was not found.
(so I guess we could assume he didn't die.)

But, if you wanted to check ALL the reboots for a particular day,
(lets say 5/11/93), you could do:

H:32016 R:1000> deathcheck Upset 051193*

or to check the whole month, you could do:

H:32016 R:1000> deathcheck Upset 05*

(Please note that checking that many files can take awhile!  Use
sparingly as you will lag the mud.)

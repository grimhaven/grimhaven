Resetting practices will set all of the players disciplines down to 0 learm.
This works exactly like the 'gain reset' command mortals can do at their
guildmaster.  The players skills and skill-toggles are not reset.
Disciplines which automatically raise (adventuring, etc) are not reset.

Resetting shops will cause all shopkeepers to junk all inventory, and then
auto-create themselves.  This essentially reverts them so they ONLY possess
unlimited items.

Resetting gold will zero out the economic data shown in "info gold".

Reseting a zone will force it to go through a repop.  Players sometime ask for
this, but it should be avoided.  This command is designed with testing LOW
related things in mind.  You can give it the "all" property for <zone>

Reseting levels resets the stats about leveling speed that gets preserved 
through reboots.

Reseting logins will reset the number of logins counter (world command) to 0.

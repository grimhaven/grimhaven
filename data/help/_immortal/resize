Resize will resize a piece of equipment to fit a target.  If that target is
an invidual player, it will also personalize the item.  There are three target
options; a character name, a race or a specific height in inches.  To see a
list of available races and their corresponding numbers use the SHOW RACE
command.

Syntax: resize <object> <character>
        resize <object> race <race number>
        resize <object> height <height>

The object must be in your inventory.  If you are resizing to fit a specific
character, they must be online.

Resizing by race or height is intended as a building tool.  You should resize
for a particular character if you are using it as a reward.

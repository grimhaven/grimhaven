Syntax: crit {victim} <crit number>

Crit allows you to instantly obtain a critical combat hit of any type
against an opponent.  If victim is not specified, it is assumed to be the
person you are fighting.

The weapon-type is dependent on your primary hand.  The part hit (if not
forced by the crit-number, is random based on the victim's race.  Damage
is dependent on the weapon-type.

A list of what each crit-number corresponds to can be found in
combat.cc::critSuccessChances().  If you don't have access to this, 
don't use this command.

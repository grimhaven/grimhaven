   Used to close the game to users for various reasons.
parameters:
   wizlock all     
      will only allow a person of god level in
   wizlock add (alpha or numeric site address)
      will lock out ALL users from that site.  Partial 
      strings are allowed.  (i.e. Ohio.edu will lockout
      any site with Ohio.edu in name.)
   wizlock rem (alpha or numeric site address)
      will remove a site (allow entry) from a currently
      locked out site.
   wizlock list
      will display what sites are locked out.
   wizlock message
      This will change the message sent to mortals when
      they get caught in wizlock. It can be changed online
      to tell the exact reason the game is wizlocked. To
      use this command, write the new message on a note,
      and then just type wizlock message, and the message
      from the note will be transfered to the wizlock message.

IF you wizlock the game, please do the following:
1.) kick all current mortals out (trans and force rent)
2.) cut all mortal links, purge, etc. (you can still reconnect otherwise)
3.) EMAIL BRUTIUS!!!  address is in credits
	be sure to mention why you did it.  i.e.  It crashed 5 times
	in 20 minutes is sufficient, but if you know or suspect a reason
	mention that too.
4.) post a wizlock message.  No need to be specific, but do be polite.
	"some random crash bug.  We'll be done at least 20 minutes, sorry"
	is perfectly fine.
5.) leave a note on the wiz board so gods coming in after you know that
	we are wizlocked and why (if you know).

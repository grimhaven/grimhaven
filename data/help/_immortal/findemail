Syntax: findemail <address>

findemail attempts to locate all accounts that use <address>.  It will look for
substrings, so please avoid doing stupid things like "findemail edu".

To simplify execution, the account files (where email address is stored) are
not formally opened, read and closed.  Instead, a simple grep for the <address>
is done on the binary account file.  It is possible that a false-positive
result will be returned if the <address> string somehow matched other binary
data within the account file.

Findemail will return a list of all accounts that had a match for <address>.
You will have to cross-reference with the account or access commands to 
find out what the actual address being used is.

Syntax : log -(w) (name)

Log used with the -w parameter will list out all PC's that are logged and
currently playing.

Log used with a player name as a parameter will act as a toggle to turn
logging of that player on/off.

Logs do tend to eat up disk space so use sparingly and/or turn it off after
you don't need it anymore.

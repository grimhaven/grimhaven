Syntax: rename <person> <new name>

Namechange allows you to change <person>'s name into <new name>.  It
should rewrite <person>'s name, force a save on them and then delete
that person's old player-file and rent-file (since they are now saved
under the <new name>).

This command is NOT heavily tested.  It is recommended that you have
the person rent all the way out and come back in just to be safe.

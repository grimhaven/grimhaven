Syntax: tasks
Syntax: tasks enable
Syntax: tasks disable
Syntax: tasks note

    To avoid having the mud hang while certain long system processes are being
    invoked, such processes are forked off by <h>.  The tasks command
    gives an interface to this forking.

    With no arguments, all presently running tasks are shown.
    The "enable" and "disable" parameters will permit/disallow tasking.

    When the forked process completes, its output is dumped to a note and
    given to whomever started the task.  To avoid consuming massive resources
    with this command, output over a given length is not dumped to a note,
    but instead to an offline file viewable through the "viewoutput" command.
    The "note" parameter displays this threshold value.

NOTE: This command is somewhat of a misnomer.  It really deals with forked
    processes (checklog, loglist, etc) and has nothing to do with mud tasks
    (sharpen, meditate, etc).

These commands utilize forking:
  MID, checklog, deathcheck, findemail, traceroute, "gamestat statistics"

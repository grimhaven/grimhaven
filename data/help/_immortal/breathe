Syntax: breath <fire | frost | acid | lightning | chlorine> <victim>

Breath will permit the user to breath like a dragon.  There are some things
to know about this:
  1: damage afflicted = XdY   where X = level - 50
  2: additional damage accrues depending on what victim is wearing
  3: item damage occurs for everything victim owns
  4: item damage ALSO occurs for every loose object in the room.

Realize this is meant as just a fun thing to play around with, use with
caution though.  Indiscriminate use versus mortal players is grounds for
demotion, unless that mortal is a total twit  :)

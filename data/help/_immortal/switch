Use this command to "possess" the body of any mobile in the game.
To return to your normal body, use the "return" command.

Syntax:  switch <name_of_mob>
Syntax:  switch load <name_of_mob>
To get back: return

Before causing a mob to do anything, be sure to read help roleplay.  You are
held responsible for any actions a mob does due to your forces or switched
presence.

switch load <name_of_mob> is identical to switch except it loads the mob
before switching into it.

Please note: Mobs prompts are fixed and are not configurable.  Some display
issues crop up if switching with term=VT or term=Ansi.  You may need to 
do a CLS to clear things up.

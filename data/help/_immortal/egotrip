This command is used for the immortal that feels like a little egotripping.
Various tricks exist, some helpful, some harmful.  Don't abuse the command
as it should be used seldomly.

Deity:
  Forces any deity of judgment in The World to "pulse" and consequently
  invoke their reward/punishment routine.

Bless:
  Causes you to cast bless on every PC in The World.

Blast:   syntax: egotrip blast <target>
  Sends a bolt of non-lethal lightning to blast <target>.  Hopefully they
  will get whatever point is being made.

Damn:  syntax: egotrip damn <target>
  Inflicts faerie fire and curse on <target>.

Hate:  syntax: egotrip hate <target>
  Causes all mobs in room to hate <target>
  Assuming that <target> is a PC, will cause the mob(s) to start hunting
  that PC.

Cleanse:
  Will cause all disease in the lands, for both PCs and NPCs, to be cured.

Wander:
  Simulates a "wander" pulse for NPCs in your current room.

Garble:
  Adds a garble effect to the player (only blahblah and pg13 will persist over rent)

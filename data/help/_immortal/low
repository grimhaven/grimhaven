This command offers some information used by the L.O.W. but it has informative
value to others as well.  In general, you can obtain information on mobs
weapons, or objs.  This command also gives online access to the L.O.W. task
list database.

Syntax for objs: low objs <body slot>
Examines all items in the database and displays them in a sorted fashion.
Only those items that are armor or worn and are wearable in the <body slot>
are displayed.  <body slot> is of the form "head", "arm", "body" etc.
Sorting is based on items AC followed by its max_structure.  Additional
info is added for price, %size and applys.  Note that finger, hold and
neck slots are all 100% as those slots are exempt from size restrictions.

Syntax for objs: low objs <body slot> race <race#>
Same as above but only shows objects that fit the given race.

Syntax for weapons: low weapons <blunt | slash | pierce>
Examines all weapons of the given attack type and displays in a sorted
fashion.  Information is displayed regarding item damage, attack type,
sharpness, price and effects.

Syntax for mobs: low mob <mob level>
Scrolls thru the mob database and picks out any mob that has a level equal to
<mob level>.  Some mobs (guildmasters, shopkeepers and the like) are ignored
and not listed.  Note that it does not sort the mobs in any fashion.  
Information displayed includes AC, number of attacks, +tohit and barehand
damage.  Hit point bonus is also displayed.  Note that level d8 hp are added
to hitBonus before the mob actually loads.  Note also that it doesn't note if
the mob is sancted.  There is also a field for the class bitvector.
class bitvector: (1=mage, 2 = cleric, 4 = warrior, 8 = thief, 16 = azruzi, 
32 = deikhan, 64 = monk, 128 = ranger)

Syntax for race: low race <race#> {section}
Displays a list of all mobs of a given <race#> and their characteristics.
Since some <race#> have a large number of members, and only a finite number
of mobs may be displayed at one time, you may specify an optional parameter
{section} to get the next grouping of mobs for that <race#>.

Syntax: low statbonus
Displays a summary of stat bonuses that eq gives.

Syntax: low statcharts
Displays a summary of character race and home territory stats.

NAME
    traceroute - prints the route that packets take to a network host

SYNOPSIS
    traceroute host

DESCRIPTION
    The traceroute command traces the route that the Internet protocol
    (IP) uses when sending a packet from the local system to the given
    remote host.  This command depends on aspects of IP that do not exist
    in every environment; therefore, it does not display hops through a
    system whose IP does not support this feature.  traceroute continues
    until the remote host is reached.  Hosts whose IP does not support the
    necessary feature show up as hops displayed as all * (asterisks).
    traceroute traces the route only from the local system to the remote
    host.

    This is a task.

Syntax: change

Change will swap items in your hands. (i.e. move what's in your left 
hand to the right and vice versa.)

(immortal version)
Syntax: change <command> <new level>

Change when immortal and level > 57 will allow you to change a given commands
minimum level.  For example, if there is a crash bug in headbutt, make it
impossible to headbutt by doing : change headbutt 60
You can only change the level on a command that you can presently use and the
new level can be no higher then 60.

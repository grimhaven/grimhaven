AT 
 
   requires a modifier (room virtual number, mob or player name) and a command
   to be executed.  Allows a god to briefly execute a command at a location 
   without requiring him to actually go there first.  Useful if he only needs
   to do something in a remote location briefly.  

   usage:  at Brutius say hello (in Brutius's room it'll show You say,'hello')

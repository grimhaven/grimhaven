  Peel's player kill (peelpk) will allow the user to run player
killing quests without player experience loss or age affects. 
The player kill quest is set up as two teams. (0 and 1) Each
teams objective is to kill the members of thier opposing team.
This code proves to be flexable and can be used in many ways 
manually to add flavor or different circumstance to the player
killing quest.

Please be sure to fill in all the needed variables before you
let anyone kill each other. Giving players reimbursments for 
your mistake can prove to be a very time consuming process.

   Allows a god of sufficient level to make a mob or pc do his bidding.
   You may only force a PC of lower level then you.  Indiscriminate use of
   this power where players are concerned (forcing them to drop all at dump)
   is a good way to get demoted.

   syntax:
   force <target> <action>

   <target> may be one of the following:

(creature name)/(player name) - it will search your present room first, if it
    does not find said target in your room, it will display a message to
    that effect and then look through world for an appropriate match.  You may
    identify a specific monster by using 1.name 2.name 3.name etc with default
    being 1.name if no number is specified.
all - forces all PC's to do the action.  Force all save is a good idea since
    players tend to forget.
mobs - forces all mobs in your room to do the action
room - forces all mobs and PC's in your room to do the action.

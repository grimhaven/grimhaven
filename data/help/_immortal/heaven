Syntax:  heaven <num>

The heaven command allows the god to move the heavens and earth forward in time
(causing the weather to change, the suns to set, etc.).  This does NOT force
a tick to occur, merely changes the game time.  Nice for WOWING the yokels.

Time will move forward 1/2 hour per num entered.

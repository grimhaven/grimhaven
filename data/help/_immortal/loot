Syntax:
  loot load <min-level> <max-level>
  loot list <min-level> <max-level> spell <spell-name> type <item-type>

Load:
  This allows you to simulate the L zonefile directive.  Main difference
is that all valid objects are loaded, not just 1.  As in the syntax this
option Only supports the level limits.  No option is Required.

List:
  Use this to get an expanded list of possible items.  When using the
spell and type directives you Must put the literal word spell or type
followed by a spell-name or item-type.  No option is Required.

Zonefile Command Syntax:
L <if> <min-level> <max-level> 0 <0=mob/1=obj/other=room>

The L command MUST come RIGHT after the container load if a container is
being used.

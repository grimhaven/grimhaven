  clone <playername> <mob vnum>

  This command will create a look-alike of the named player, including
  equipment (flagged norent).  The 'access' wizpower is required for its
  use.

  The name of the mob is the player name, with "[clone]" appended.
  Use "name-[clone]" for manipulation of the clone.

  The clone currently retains mob stats.  This means that it has very
  high hp and very low damage compared to PCs of its level.

Requires a modifier, specifically your immortal player name, 
and a command to be executed.  Allows a god who has "switch"ed 
into a mob to force his immortal character, who is temporarily 
in storage, to perform some wizard command not available to the 
mob you have switched into.  This allows you to do things like 
force a mob to say something while you're switched into another 
mob, or have your immortal "restore" the mob you have switched into.

More specifically, the following events occurs when the "as" 
command is used: the switched-into mob performs the "as" command, 
the immortal character is moved to the same room as the mob, 
the immortal character performs the command, the immortal 
character is moved back to his original location.  For this
 reason, it is best to be invisible and silent when switching 
into a mob so future uses of the "as" command does not result 
in messages going out to others announcing the actions of your 
immortal character, who happens to temporarily be in the same 
room as them.

Usage: as <immortal-name> <command>

Warning: Do *NOT* use the following commands as parameters to the 
"as" command: quit, rent, cutlink, or anything else that could 
cause your immortal to leave the game while you are switched 
into the mob.  Doing so will lead to evil results.

Example: I'm playing Quazi.
> invis 59
> stealth
> switch mayor
> say I am the mayor. You are scum. Guards, take this man to prison.
> as Quazi force watchman say Come with me or die.
> as Quazi force watchman kill stargazer
> cackle
> as Quazi at 10 load o white-potion
> as Quazi give potion mayor
> quaff potion

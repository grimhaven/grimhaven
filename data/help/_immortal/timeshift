This command allows you to move the mud backward in time and should be used
to cancel the effects of mud down-time/inaccessibility.

Syntax:  timeshift (minutes to shift)

Each player in rent will be credit gold for the time shifted.  Each player
on-line will receive additional gold (in-hand) in proportion to their rent
cost and time-shift amount.  Additionally, the mud-time will move backwards
in accordance with the timeshift.

theoretical problems not dealt with:
1.) online characters gold-adjustment is based on current items worth.
Character's who have dropped or gained equipment between logging in and
time when function called will receive bogus amount.
2.) Obviously characters losing an item to the pawn-shop for rent reasons also
won't be credited for having said item when the function is called.
3.) It's possible to come in with negative rent charges if the amount of
time you are rented is less then the timeshift.  If the timeshift is done
properly, this should not be a major problem.

Bottom Line here: use this kludge function sparingly as it probably introduces
as many problems as it tries to solve.

Replace transfers an old backup of a player's character, equipment, or account
into the working directory.  The player must be offline completely for this
to work (so force them to rent).

Backups are made automatically (generally at midnight) each day.  Today's
backup represents the last midnight, yesterday's backup would be 1 day earlier.
Due to space limitations, only 2 backups are kept for online restoration.

Syntax:
replace <player> <"player" | "rent" | "account"> <"today" | "yesterday">

eg.
replace Mithros rent yesterday

Realize that replace erases any mistakes that player might have made, like
deaths or selling equipment.  You should make an effort to check for deaths
or look into artifacts that appear due to replaces.

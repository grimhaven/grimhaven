Syntax: comment <player>

Comment can be used to store information about <player>.  For example, if you
give a player a warning about breaking the rules, it would be a good idea to
add a comment saying you did so.  This way other immortals know who has been
warned about what, and by whom.

Comments will be displayed when the player is accessed.

Comments are stored on a per account basis.

Since comments are maintained indefinitely, and the admins don't want to be
hassled by having to go thru and delete things, please don't comment stupid
things.  Commenting that Brutius has smelly breath will probably get you
demoted.

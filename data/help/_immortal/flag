syntax: FLAG [player name] [flag type]

Available flag types:

1) banished
  Banished can only be set by a god.  A banished player will automatically
  enter the game at 70 (Hell) where there should be a tormenter waiting.
  Low level players who appear to merely be playing for the sake of causing
  mischief (harassment/spamming) should be banished.
2) solo
3) group
  These two flags are new quest flags. The solo flag will make the person
  work totally solo. It prevents any following of the person flagged, and
  also prevent any spells being cast on the person. The group flag does 
  essentially the same thing, but allows interaction between others with
  the group quest flag.
4) newbiehelper
  Flags these people as likely to assist newbies.  Probably should only be done
  with that person's permission.  Reserved as a god command so that we can place
  some controls on who gets it.  The newbie helper flag shows up in WHO.
5) nosnoop
  Prevents anyone from snooping this character.  There is no good reason
  to set this.
6) killable
  Use this to let people kill a newbie.

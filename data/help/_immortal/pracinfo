The pracinfo command calculates the number of practices a player is expected
to have for his/her class, level (current experience), and current intelligence,
and compares this to an estimate of how many the player actually received.  The
estimate is an average of 10 trials, and appears to be correct within 1 practice
the majority of the time.

Things that may affect total practices include:
- aging effects were removed, but used to affect practices; therefore there may
  be many older characters whose numbers are somewhat off in one direction or
  the other (the old practice of wearing rings that aged a player while they
  gained their level (before practices were awarded continuously) also comes
  in here)
- disciplines have been added, and the number of practices that a player
  receives between the level when they finish basic training and level 50 is a
  direct function of the number and type of advanced disciplines they have
  available to them; for this reason most older players, especially in classes
  that used to have fewer weapon specializations available, will have
  greater practice deficits
- potions of learning
- a coder fiddling with the 'class tweak' for the fraction of advanced
  learning that each class gets
- the @set command
- random chance:  players have a random chance to get their fractional practices
  at the end of each level, and can 'get lucky' (or unlucky)

SYNTAX:  pracinfo <playername>

NOTE:  The player must be online for this command to function.

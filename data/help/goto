Syntax: goto <place>
Syntax: goto fairfight

To help you to learn your way around our main city of Grimhaven, you may
use the "goto" command to get step-by-step directions to many major land-
marks and important destinations.

Example: goto cs
Will output: You can get to Center Square by going <direction(s)>.

The "goto" command will only work while in Grimhaven and only for   
destinations within Grimhaven.  If you're too far away or inside some  
of Grimhaven's bigger structures, you may find you're just not familiar
enough with the area to get your bearings.

Some sample destinations:
Inn, rent, cs, center square, armor, weapon, food, drink, repair, sharpener, 
mail, symbol, commodity, component, supply, light, doctor, bank, attuner, 
tanner, Quazar, Taloc, Prigon, surplus, park, newbie area.

To find your class trainer, type "goto trainer".
To find another discipline's trainer, type "goto <discipline>".
To find your guildmaster to accept a quest, type "goto <class>"
     or "goto guildmaster"
     Important note about guildmasters: They only give out quests, they
     cannot train you in any disciplines.  Type "goto trainer" to find
     your class trainer.

Only basic trainers can be found using "goto".  Your first trainer will
give you hints on finding the second trainer, and a certain whiskey-loving
barfly will sing you a song to help you find advanced discipline trainers.

You may also use goto to locate the closest mob that is the same level
you are. Type "goto fairfight" to be directed to the nearest mob that
considers at "fair fight" for your level.

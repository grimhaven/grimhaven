Characters may be any of the following races at present:

human		ogre		hobbit
elf		gnome		dwarf

Humans represent the vast bulk of the population of The World and anyone new
to mudding in general or to <h> in particular is recommended to be a
human.

The main differences in the races is their particular weight and height
(and as a consequence, what items are available for them to wear).  Humans
tend to have stats only in the average range.  This means that they don't excel
in any stat, but likewise aren't lacking in any area.  Non-human classes vary
in their stats.  They may be extremely high in one field, but extremely low
in another.  It is important to know these differences when choosing a non-
human race so that an appropriate class for that race can be chosen wisely.

Additionally, each non-human race has various special abilities.  These
range from infravision to various immunities.  Not all the abilities are
beneficial, for instance dwarven fear of water.

Please be aware that the vast majority of The World is human.  As such is the
case, most equipment has been constructed by humans for other humans or by
non-humans to be sold to "those dumb humans"  (as in, "those dumb humans will
pay a lot for a sword this good.")  Be advised that if you chose to play a
non-human, be prepared for a scarcity of usable equipment.  Non-human sized
artifacts are exceptionally rare.

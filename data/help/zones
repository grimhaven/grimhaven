Syntax: zones

Lists all zones in The World along with an indication of what level the zone
is for.  This information is NOT meant as a recommendation of where to go
adventuring and should be used only for informational purposes.  Use it at
your own risk.

Passing a number argument will show information about a single zone.

If you use the "mid" or "median" argument with this command, the output will
be sorted by median average of levels.  Normally the zones are sorted by mean
average with a standard deviation.

Examples:
  zones
  zones median
  zones 14

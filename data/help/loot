Syntax: toggle loot-money
Syntax: toggle loot-all

The loot-money and loot-all toggles allow you to select from automatically
looting talens, all items including talens or no items from the corpse of 
the mob you have slain.

Most players keep loot-all toggled to on in order to take everything from
a corpse.

Toggling loot-all off is useful in situations where the corpse may contain
undesirable items or you have limited inventory and wish to selectively
loot individual items from a corpse.   Pairing loot-all off with loot-money
on will allow you to automatically get all talens off a corpse but leave
all items intact on the corpse for you to loot at your leisure.

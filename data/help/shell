<h> has built in commands duplicating commands found in the
commonly used Unix shells.  The available features are:

!!           	- Repeat your last command
!<num>         	- Repeat number num command from your history
^<exp>^<exp2> 	- Search the last command for exp, and replace it with exp2
!<exp>        	- repeat last command started with <exp>

For instance, if your history looks like this :

[0] say hi
[1] say hi again
[2] say This is a test
[3] get all corpse
[4] laugh Nosferatu
[5] shout Congratulations!
[6] think
[7] eat ration
[8] say Where is the fountain?
[9] history

!1 would result in : "say hi again"
!say would result in : "say Where is the fountain?"
!say hi would result in : "say hi again"
^h^t would result in "tistory"

If you have any questions about shell capabilities, ask an immortal.

!NOTE! : The ^ ability is not supported at this time

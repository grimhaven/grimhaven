Syntax: sit {object}

Sit causes you to sit down and get comfortable.  While sitting, you receive
the benefit of an increased regeneration rate for the duration that you
remain sitting.

Various objects can be sat on.  These objects will increase your
regeneration even further as they provide a comfortable place to sit.
Obviously, the object must be big enough to sit on, as you can't stretch
out and get comfortable on just anything.  Also, objects designed for
small creatures may prove to be a bit too uncomfortable to provide any
benefit.  Note that SIT BED will sit on the first unoccupied BED in the room.

To stop sitting, merely stand up or change to some other position.

<R>WARNING:<z> Sitting can be detrimental to the lifeforce of a Shaman.

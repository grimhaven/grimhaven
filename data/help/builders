Builders are the volunteers that create the zones we play in.  They
write the descriptions of all the rooms, objects and creatures in the
zone.  When applying to become a builder, you should meet the following 
criteria:

1. Have spent sufficient time on <h> that you know the "flavor" of the
    mud, as well as what's average and can be expected.
2. Have enough free time and disposition to finish a small zone.
3. Have an idea for a zone (it must mesh with overall theme of <h>).

If you want to give it a try, contact the LOW or another immortal and
express your interest. 

Note: it is not necessary for you to have any coding experience at all.  
Building is mostly a lot of tedious data entry, although the reward can
be worth the effort.

Also: <h> zones must be unique.  We do not accept zones from other muds.
All zones become the intellectual property of <h>.

Syntax: abort

The stop and abort commands are synonymous.
Many commands on <h> require a set amount of time to carry out
and require the character performing the task to maintain focused on
the task.  If events require the task to be stopped, these commands
can be used.

Aborting or stopping a task will cause any progress on the task to be
lost.  IE. You can not partially do a task, stop it and then pick up
where you left off.  Once stopped, you'd restart from the beginning.

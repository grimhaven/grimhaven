An area effect spell is one that affects more than a 
single victim at once.  e.g., a mage can cast the spell 
'fireball' to engulf a band of roving thugs in a bath 
of fire.  Area effect spells effect everyone in the room
except the caster and anyone in the caster's group.

Care should be taken when casting these spells as it is 
easy to accidentally affect an unknowing PC who 
accidentally walks in on the festivities right before the 
spell is cast.

Syntax: send <message>

Send will allow a faction leader to send <message> to all current faction 
members online.

Use this command with discretion and only for faction business.  Abusing it
like it was some gossip channel will cause further prohibitions to be placed
on its usage as well as possible sanctions being undertaken against the
offender and their faction.

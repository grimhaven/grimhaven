Syntax: value <object>

In a shop, this command will tell you what the shopkeeper is willing
to pay for the item or how much it will cost to have work done (repair,
cutlery, etc).

In a post office, this command will tell you how much sending mail,
talens, an item or mailing your faction will cost.  Simply use the same
syntax as the 'mail' command but omit the person and use 'value' instead
of 'mail'.

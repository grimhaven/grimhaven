MUD TERMINOLOGY AND MUDDISMS:
tank     (noun)
tanking  (verb)

The tank or tanking generally refers to the person that acts as the target of
the monster's attacks.  For example, if A, B and C are grouped and attack MOB,
MOB will start to fight one of them and this person is known as the tank.  
Because the tank absorbs the majority of the damage in the battle, the tank
needs to be fairly buff and is typically a warrior-type.

Learning what determines who the tank will be in any given attack is one of the
first thing any newbie should learn.

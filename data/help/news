Syntax: news <search>

This command will show you the current edition of "The <h>
news", a publication dedicated to news and useful information about
this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while.

News will detail the most recent changes and is maintained more diligently
than the help files.  News supersedes any help file, but the help files
are usually updated as a news item becomes aged.

Most changes made in the code will be put here with date the change was made.  
Changes of a textual (spelling/grammar errors, etc) will not be reported.
Changes to infrastructure (improved efficiency of code base, etc) will not
be reported provided the change is thought to have no impact on game play.
Changes that merely provide extra, or reorganize information will also not
be reported (self-evident).

Passing an argument will cause only entries that contain that string
to be displayed.

Example: news repair
This command would display all news entries containing the word "repair".

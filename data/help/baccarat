The Baccarat table is located in the casino.  You must sit at the
Baccarat table to start.  You must place a bet to get the cards dealt.
Syntax: BET <chip> <player|dealer|tie>

The object of Baccarat is to guess which hand (yours or the dealers)
will come out closer to 9, or if there will be a tie.  Aces count for
1, 10 and higher counts as 0.  The first digit of a 2 digit score is
discarded.  Thus, if you draw a 5 and 7, your score is 2.

After your cards are dealt, you may choose to draw another card.
Syntax: HIT

After you choose whether or not to take a hit, you must stay to see
the final hands.
Syntax: STAY

Payout for a tie is 8 to 1, other payouts are 2 to 1.

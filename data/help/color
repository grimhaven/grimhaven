Users with ANSI-capable MUD clients or terminals may choose to play with
color enabled.  Color has been organized into categories so players may
pick and choose what elements of the MUD are in color.

Color may be toggled on or off with "color enable" or "color disable".
You may choose to selectively view color by the categories listed above.
Use "color all" to select all categories.  "Color none" will disable
all color.

"Color test" will show all colors used so you may see how each color
displays on your terminal.

Additionally, hard to see colors may be	replaced with ones more	easily
viewed with the	use of COLOR SUBSTITUTE	and COLOR REPLACE.

Type "color sub <color>" to choose a substitute color, then type "color 
replace <color>" to replace colors you cannot easily see with the color 
you've chosen as a substitute.

Example: If your terminal is white-on-black, you may not be able to see
the colors black and grey.  Type "color sub white" to choose white as
your replacement color, then type "color replace black" and "color replace
grey" to replace black and grey with your substitute color.

To clear your substitute color, choose "none" as your substitute color.
To toggle replacement of a color, type "color replace <color>".

The MUD has color on by default, so if you have a terminal that does
not suppor color, disable color.  This decreases processing and band-
width usage.

You may use color yourself in says, tells, shouts, titles, notes and
mail. To do so, type HELP COLOR STRING for more info.

If you feel something should (or should not) be colorized, please feel
free to make use of the IDEA command.

Finally, <h> uses the ANSI standard for transmission of color to the 
end user. Only ANSI-capable clients or terminals will interpret color
codes correctly.  If you find not all colors show up and your substitute
and replace settings are correct, it's more likely to be your terminal 
and not <h>.  Depending on your display, client or terminal, you may 
also note variations in hue or intensity.

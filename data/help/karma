Karma represents a person's inherent spirit or soul.  It manifests itself in
numerous ways, often being mistaken for the character's personality, affability
and leadership qualities.  But it also represents a strength of belief that
makes it important to those philosophers or theologians that must preach a
certain way of life.

Karma as a game stat has an otherworldly affect that often presents itself
as luck.  Karma has a number of indirect affects on combat. High karma
characters seem to receive premonitions of disaster allowing them to avoid
damage or other nasty effects and to have fortunate things happen to them
more often.  Their karma seems to cause the fates to rescue them from
impending doom.  To the contrary, low karma people often seem walking
disaster areas and can't ever seem to buy a break.

Syntax: toggle pouch

Toggling pouch on will cause you to automatically open, loot and drop any
monepouches you pick up or loot from corpses.   Toggling pouch off will
allow you to simply collect moneypouches in your inventory.

NOTE: Some moneypouches may be booby-trapped.  Automatically opening all
moneypouches may put you at risk.

Holy symbols are the devices through which a cleric communes with
their deity.  It acts as a conduit for focusing the will of the deity
upon The World.

A symbol to be usable must be attuned to a players faction. If
unaffiliated the symbol must be attuned generally.  To attune a symbol,
the cleric or deikhan can find an attuner in The World or use the attune
skill.  Professional attuners will in general be cheaper and quicker.

Most symbols must be held, although their are a few symbols that will
work when worn about the neck.

While symbols are quite good at focusing a deity's will, they are 
affected by this reaction.  The more difficult or powerful the prayer,
the more damage a given symbol will take.  It is a wise idea to keep
your eyes out for more durable symbols so that the more powerful prayers
are possible.  The damage that a symbol accrues from prayer chanting is
internal disruption and as such is not repairable.

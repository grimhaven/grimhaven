Syntax: inventory <filter>

The inventory command will list what items you are carrying.  Note that
you must actually be able to see the item, so if low light conditions are
present, you may actually have the item but be unable to see it and hence
not have it displayed when you use use the inventory command.

If the optional filter argument is used, only items whose keywords match 
the filter will be listed.

Note:
MIN(x,y) is defined as the lesser of x or y.
MAX(X,Y) is the greater of x, y.
MOBXP(x) is the amount of XP a mob of level X has.  This is an irregular curve
  that roughly doubles every 2-3 levels

Death: xp loss
  loss = lesser of:
       1/5 your current xp, or
       25 * MOBXP(your current level)
 
Rent Credit:
  /* rent is currently deactivated */
  Type: "rent credit" for further information.
  Rent credit is based on the theory that the appropriate gear for your class
  and level should be rented for free.  Allowances are made for the cost of
  a weapon, the cost of the AC and durability that equipment provides, the
  cost of sundries (bags, lanterns, etc), and the cost of class-based items
  (components, symbols, etc).  Rent credit is simply the sum of the prices for
  all the component pieces, each with their own quirks.  Unfortunately, such
  a setup prevents a simple algorhythm from being provided for a rent credit
  formula.
  Roughly speaking, it is level based, and adjusted for class.  Additionally,
  to discourage power leveling a storage character, playtime is a factor
  (downward) in setting rent credit.
  Rent credit will only increase and never decreases.

Repair item deletion:

   /* Automatic rent deletion is currently deactivated */
   Rent file deletion follows the same rules as player-file deletion.

XP Sharing for Group:
  xp received = xp_for_hit * personal_share / group_total_shares
   xp_for_hit = current_xp_of_mob * dam_of_hit / current_hp_of_mob
    personal_share = MOBXP(current_level of PC)
    total_shares = sum of all personal_shares

Basic Pre-reqs:
  Must maintain ((3.5* level) -4) in combat or theology/lore 
  Must finish combat to go into a weapon specialty
  Must finish basic class discipline and 100 combined training
     in lore/theology/combat to continue into advanced training.

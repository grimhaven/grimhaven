12-24-01 : You can now chop flying creatures if you are flying.

12-14-01 : New adventuring skill: Butcher: Will allow the butchering of
	   corpses. Butchering will create food (steak/meat) objects in
	   your inventory that you can...yup...thats right...eat.

12-14-01 : Rejoice, for emote actions now on objects.  This might cause some
           odd grammar, but I think it works right for the most part.

12-12-01 : Added "help index".  The web based help has been updated as well.

11-16-01 : Ranger enhancement: Barkskin now lasts a longer duration
           (based on level)

11-16-01 : Made arrows sharpen twice as fast as before. Arrows, since
           they only need the tips sharpened, should sharpen faster than
	   large swords.

11-16-01 : Added argument "all" to the clear command to clear all 
           aliases

11-11-01 : Upped the maximum screensize based on popular demand to 128.
         
11-10-01 : The world command now shows the number of mobs that have never
           been killed by any player, since trophy was started.  Yes, more
           than 1/5 of mobs have never even been attacked.

11-09-01 : Shop ownership functions are now restricted to one character 
           per account.  Only permissions for the FIRST character set
           per account will be valid.

11-06-01 : Due to a lot of inquiry about charm reimbursals I have updated
           HELP PET to reflect what is in other helpfiles on the subject
           of reimbursement of pets or thier belongings.

11-02-01 : Clarification added to some rules files with support in
           character creation.  It would be a good idea to reread and
           become familiar with the rules of the game.  This action has
           been prompted by repeat multiplaying offenses.  There will
           be no warnings. Use of the mud is considered agreement to
           adhere to the regulations of SneezyMUD.

10-29-01 : Fixed affects that modify max hp.  I think this is only for
           berserk.

10-28-01 : Added a new sort of shop to Grimhaven. Explore the market and
	   SPEND DAT LOOT!

10-23-01 : The Grimhaven Anti-Fraud Commission now requires all shopkeepers
           to divulge their profit ratios and the type of products they
           carry, even if they are privately owned.

10-17-01 : Added profit ratio setting for individual items for owned shops,
           check shop owner help file for details. 

10-17-01 : You should be able to "whisper" commands to all shops now.

10-17-01 : Fixed some shops that weren't working at all.

10-16-01 : Update to sacrifice and a bug fix. Sacrificing with a totem
           will now require the totem to be held in your right hand.
           See help SACRIFICE.

10-16-01 : NEW SHAMAN RITUAL: Cleanse. It will remove syphilis. Please
           see the help file.

10-14-01 : Syphilis Update: Removed it from being a generic infection
	   and moved it into death mists affects. In the future it will
	   cureable by shaman. Help DEATH MIST will give a clue as to
	   how one can gt syphilis. 

10-10-01 : BLOOD DRINKERS BEWARE! Added syphilis to the game as an
           infectuous disease. Possible to get by cleric prayer, object
           proceedure, or DRINKING POOLS OF BLOOD. Don't complain...this
           is your warning.

10-03-01 : NEW SHAMAN RITUAL: Chase spirits. Please see the help file.

10-03-01 : Added immunity failure messages to shaman rituals.

10-03-01 : Djalla's and Legba's protections will now show all affects.

10-03-01 : Dispel Magic modification: The spell now includes affects 
	   invoked by shaman.

09-20-01 : Spin modification: Spin is 50% more difficult to execute on a
           victim that is flying.

09-20-01 : Non-player owned shops now save their talens and will not reset
           at boot time.  This will probably fux0r everything up, but it's
           just an experiment.  If things go badly we'll switch back.
           Shop taxes have been turned off temporarily.

09-18-01 : Added a new item to the whittle list, and removed the 
           ability to kill oneself by whittling ( no more slipping 
           with the knife, costing valuable hp ).

09-18-01 : The Grimhaven Stock Exchange has finished setting up their office,
           south of the House of Sale.  Although stock purchasing is not
           yet allowed, you can view the various stocks offered.

09-18-01 : The fishmasters topten list now shows the number of records each
           player has as well as the total weight of caught fish.

09-16-01 : Catching fish now gives you a tiny amount of experience.

09-16-01 : Fishing now looks for bait anywhere in inventory (bags etc)
           as well as worn equipment (fishing vest).

09-15-01 : Added some new regional fish types.

09-15-01 : Keirk the fisherman has built a small dock under his fishing shop,
           and now runs a chartered fishing boat from there.

09-14-01 : Fixed the scribe skill for mages. It is limited to spells
           known by the mage. No cross class spells were included.

09-09-01 : The fishmaster now gives a bounty on caught fish.  100 talens
           per pound for record breakers and 2 talens per pound for regular.

09-08-01 : The fishmaster now tracks the largest fish caught for each type.
           Whisper "records" to him for a list.

09-08-01 : Changed the "big one" fishing code around a bit.  There is now
           much larger range of extra big fish, with varying degrees of
           chance.

09-07-01 : Oddly enough, the recent rent change broke fishing.  Even more
           oddly, I lowered the fishing supply prices at almost exactly
           the same time, by coincidence.  Ain't that funny.  Sorry for
           the mixup, fishing should work now.  Condolences to Colossus
           who spent like forever fishing and didn't catch anything.

09-06-01 : New functionality for trophy: "trophy summary"!  Woo!

09-06-01 : Alcohol tolerance as a result of the alcoholism skill has been
           greatly increased!  Woo!

09-06-01 : All fishing supplies cut in price by 90%!  Woo!

09-06-01 : SNEEZY BOD change:  The rent system has been redone,
           everything is now free to rent.  However, there are some
           quirks.  Very high level equipment will not be as effective
           on low level players, and there is a chance repo mobs will
           hunt down higher level equipment on low level players.

09-05-01 : Crit head crush death and beheading now ALWAYS check for eq.
           Before, there was a 33% chance of instant death regardless
           of eq worn.

09-04-01 : Everyone can look into adjacent rooms now, just like 'spy'.
           I found this on my todo list from 1998 and Cosmo said it was
           a good idea.  Better late than never.

08-30-01 : Permadeath monument now supports color.  Yey.

08-26-01 : For all you slow people, the preceeding news item was a joke.
           Now really, I wouldn't do something mean like that. :)

08-17-01 : Removed the exp cap in favor of a more indirect method of
           plevel control.  Now, if you fight stuff that you would have
           hit the exp cap on, you get crit killed.  Enjoy.

08-17-01 : Fixed a bug with invis that allowed you to stay invisible
           while fighting.

08-16-01 : There's a statue in market square, with a plaque listing
           the 10 highest level perma-death characters.

08-16-01 : Shaman Adjustment: Added a little bit of newbie protection to
	   shaman. When lifeforce was down to 0 natural drain demanded
	   hitpoint drain in place of the lack of lifeforce. This is no
	   longer true to shaman level 5 or below. Once you get above
	   level 5 your hitpoints will be at risk if your lifeforce is
	   at 0. A shaman level 5 or belowwill no longer die from a lack 
	   of lifeforce. (or shouldn't)

08-15-01 : Added a new character creation option: Perma Death.  If you
           select this option while creating a character, then that char
           will only be allowed to die once and then become inaccessible.
           Who's got the cojones to play perma death?  Oh, "who -x" will
           show perma death players.

08-14-01 : There has been a slight problem with duplicate spell components.
	   I removed the duplicates and replaced them with hairballs. If 
	   anyone has any hairballs please junk them and tell Jesus how many
	   you junked. Jesus will replace with the component intended. 
	   Sorry for the inconveinence.

08-14-01 : Shaman are now enabled. Please heed the warning in character
	   creation about the class. If there are any problems with the
	   class (bugwise) mudmail directly to Jesus for the time being.
	   Enjoy!

07-17-01 : Factored age adjustments back into the hp formula.

07-16-01 : New hp code is in.  Cringe.

07-15-01 : Adjusted the hp formula again.  I think this may be the final
           adjustment, so if all goes well this may be moved in.  Also,
           a defense discipline was added, which will go into affect with
           the new hp system.

07-14-01 : Adjusted the hp formula mentioned below.

07-14-01 : Added a line to 'score' to show what your max hp would be if
           I implement the skill based HP code.  More details can be found
           here: http://grimhaven.org/peel/#skillhp

07-13-01 : Messed around with the burn code a bit.  The burn ticks now
           go a little faster, furniture will now catch on fire as a
           result of room flaming (fireball etc), and burning objects
           can now sometimes catch other objects in the room on fire.

07-09-01 : Today is double exp/no repop/no trophy day!  That's right,
           all exp is double, no zones will repop and trophy will not
           limit your exp (although it still tallies), all day long,
           or until we run out of mobs and get bored.  Enjoy.

07-03-01 : Tweaked the time system some more.  Most stuff should be as
	   before.  Damage and exp rates lowered again.

07-03-01 : I shuffled some things around for shaman that may have some affect 
           on mages or clerics. If you notice anything strange when you
	   list your faith or wizardry disc/spells, let me know as soon
           as possible so I can fix. This only applies to learning and 
           and skill level. -Jesus

07-02-01 : Fixed a bug with the mob hate code.  In short, if a mob hated
           someone who was both a player and mob (ie, polymorph, immortal
           'switch', disguise, that new shaman skill, etc) then they
           wouldn't be able to attack them.  And yes, I found this bug as 
           a result of Skirmish walking around the bank disguised and not
           getting attacked.  If anyone wants a specific technical
           description involving bad choices of C++ virtual function 
           overloading, feel free to give me a tell.

07-02-01 : MAJOR GAMEPLAY CHANGE:
	   Game speed has been adjusted... combat has been slowed down,
           and damage/exp rates have been turned up.  Hopefully these
	   factors will cancel out and keep overall gains for your time
	   the same, but there may be complications.  Bug problems and
           expect mild/minor tweaking over the next week or so.

07-02-01 : I put the burn code back to the way it was, setting equipment
           on fire instead of destroying it.  I also cut the initial
           eq damage by 80%, so less eq will get destroyed.

07-02-01 : 'paying tax' no longer shows in shop logs, however it will still
           be shown in log summaries.

07-01-01 : Fixed a speed bug which was hounding us for a while... regen
	   tasks such as yoginsa, penance, meditate, were going way too
           fast, so you will notice an obvious decrease in speed now.
           This is intended.

07-01-01 : Shaman mobile use of thralls temporarily disabled.

07-01-01 : Below news item reverted.

07-01-01 : Mobile action was slowed down a bit. This change will affect
	   tasking, mob aggro, mob sounds. Everything passing through
           Mobile Action will be affected so things may seem slower. This
           change has to do with the new machine we are housed on. Trying
	   to compensate for the larger CPU and more RAM memory.

06-24-01 : Shaman mobiles will now use charms/thralls. Be aware.

06-23-01 : Due to popular player request, flamestrike has been reverted
           to the old behavior of simply destroying eq instead of
           setting it on fire.  Enjoy.  (No I don't understand why you
           guys asked for this, but who am I to argue)

06-23-01 : Redid the zones command a bit.

06-20-01 : 'trophy zone' will now show stats for the zone you are in.

06-12-01 : Beware of smarter shaman mobs. I posted a warning in the news
           a while ago. This will remind you. I have been adding new spells
           to shaman and shaman mobs WILL utilize these spells. You have
           been warned.

06-11-01 : Trophy output reformatted a bit.  You can also do
           'trophy zone grimhaven' for example, to search zone names.

06-07-01 : Component shops will now buy and sell partially used components.

06-07-01 : Shop rent taxes have increased by 300%.

06-05-01 : Reworked cudgel a little bit.  Mobs where you fail the cudgel
           are more alert and expecting an attack, which makes later
           attempts more difficult.  Same for backstabs.

05-29-01 : Small bug with stealing from cudgeled mobs should be fixed.
     
05-27-01 : It's 4:50 in the morning and I fixed the antigravity crash
           bug.  I highly doubt anyone will either notice, or care.

05-24-01 : The hard limit on the experience cap has been removed.  Have fun.

05-24-01 : Components will no longer decay when held by a shopkeeper.

05-22-01 : Owned shops will now charge the right prices for stuff.  Basically,
           I screwed up the formula that calculates the charisma bonus, so
           everyone effectively had negative charisma in regard to owned
           shops.  Oops.  Also, I uncovered the "disappearing money" bug:
           owned shops are charged a tax every tick, which I wasn't logging
           and had forgotten about.  It is now recorded in the shop logs.

05-21-01 : Shop ownership is now ON for public beta testing.  In other
           words, it probably works, but don't blame me if it's messed up.

05-21-01 : Due to an oversight, the chance of eq catching on fire was way 
           too high.  Fixed. 

05-20-01 : All shops in the world are currently run by governments or
           wealthy private parties, usually at a loss.  In order to
           save money for Grimhaven, the King has begun testing the
           possibility of private shop ownership.  The King will help
           fund a single business venture and if it works out, all shops
           may be available for private ownership.

05-19-01 : RANGERS: Examine the nature discipline for reissue of the
           old ranger spells "Tree Walk" and "Living Vines".

05-17-01 : We now have workable spellbags for neck and wrist slots.

05-15-01 : Added a few mobs to the Grimhaven area. These mobs are shaman.
           Just be aware if you see them doing unfamiliar things.

05-11-01 : Added a player settable 'nojunk' flag to objects to protect
	   valueables from being inadvertantly junked.  HELP NOJUNK
	   for details.

05-11-01 : Rooms can be "fished out".  Catch some fish = no more fish
           in that room.  Resets on reboot.

05-06-01 : Tweaked the price of potions/scrolls.  It went up.

04-28-01 : Shaman mobs are actually shaman class now, be careful of the
           unexpected.

04-25-01 : The portal prayer will now target only special rooms designed
           to be portal destination rooms.  You will be able to open
           portals to those rooms from anywhere.  The rooms will be
           obvious when you encounter them, but will be fairly limited
           in number.  To start with, try: "pray portal grimhaven".

04-25-01 : Split and auto split will no longer count pets and
           charmed mobs as having a share. 

04-25-01 : Stand will now stop the extinguish command.

04-24-01 : Fixed a long time bug in social targetting where the
           mud would not check for exact name of target first.

04-22-01 : Updated the extinguish code a little more. Extinguishing yourself
           should be a bit faster and the damage a bit less. 
           YES...you can attempt to extinguish yourself when not on fire.
           NO....I'm not sure I want to change that.
           YES...you still have to stop yourself from the task when done.
           NO....I'm not sure that I want to change that either.
           Please direct other questions about the task to the mob that
           invoked the flamestrike on you. :)

04-22-01 : Fixed a typo Damescena really hated.

04-21-01 : Updated the affects of the flame code a bit more. Spellbags
           and other component containers will now be virtually immune
           to the flame code. Also, the chances of flames entering other
           containers was reduced a little.

04-21-01 : The extinguish command has been altered. "Extinguish me" will
           now make a player stop, drop, and roll to extinguish burning
           equipment that is worn. This task WILL NOT affect a players
           inventory, those items will have to be extinguished by dropping
           them on the ground and extinguishing them individually.

04-20-01 : There is now a fishmaster in the fishing shop, look at him for
           more info.  Also, thanks to the people who looked up fish and bait
           information for me, I appreciate the help.

04-19-01 : Ok, NOW the fishing code is in.  It might still be a little
           buggy and it'll need some tweaking, but it's in.  Look for a 
           fishing shop near a river, to the south of GH.

04-19-01 : In case you hadn't noticed, beta testing has begun on the
           new fishing code.  Stop bugging me about when it's going
           to go in, I'll let you know, trust me.

04-18-01 : Audible alert added to flame code to let you know when
           your on fire.....more to come.

04-17-01 : Charred equipment light bug has been squashed.

04-16-01 : Repair tickets for limited items now cost the same rent
 	   the item would.

04-16-01 : Identify will no longer show a rent cost on items that
	   don't cost rent.

04-16-01 : Fixed the bug with burning equipment.

04-15-01 : Changed the way mobs develop hatreds slightly.  They
           should no longer hate you unless you do something
           harmful/offensive to them

04-15-01 : Scrolls produced from copy now slowly disintegrate.
           Actual speed for disintegration depends on skill of the
           caster.

04-14-01 : New skill added to adventuring discipline: alcoholism.  
	   First person to max it gets a special item, talk to Peel.

04-14-01 : Level 40 warriors will now have a class quest available
           to them.

04-13-01 : Cityguards will no longer attract help without shouting.

04-10-01 : Rate of passing out as a result of being drunk lowered.

04-09-01 : Response mobs will now drop an object if they cannot give
	   it to you. Yay!

04-09-01 : Repair times were rounding down to the last 30 second
           mark. (ie, all repair times were multiples of 30 seconds)
           so I fixed this.  Thus, you may notice a slight (< 30 sec)
           increase in repair times

04-09-01 : I tweaked the way things burn a little to make a flame
           engulfing attacks less devestating in terms of eq damage.
           Also, this means you can now repair charred items, HOWEVER
           an item being charred SEVERLY effects how well it can be
           repaired.

04-07-01 : Hunting mobs no longer say "Time to die, someone" if they
	   can't see who you are.  They still attack if they have
	   infravision, however.

04-07-01 : The number of mobs killed in the TROPHY command now shows
	   two decimal places.

04-07-01 : Aggro mobs who wander out of their 'home' areas are now
           nicer to lowbies.  Also, aggro mobs wont attack players
	   much higher than they are.

04-07-01 : Slight discrepancy between objects that cost rent and
	   objects that SAY they cost rent fixed. :)

04-07-01 : Sword in foot crit does less raw damage, but more damage
	   to foot.

04-03-01 : Examination of items will now show whether or not you
           will have to pay to rent them.

03-31-01 : Whales no longer disarm.

03-26-01 : Made retreating a little bit nicer.  It should kick in
	   a little better now.

03-26-01 : Did you know you could track through portals?  I didn't,
	   so this is news to me.  

03-26-01 : Mounts should no longer get brawled.

03-26-01 : Um. Clientmessage does shout now.

03-26-01 : Fixed the mobs with wolverine healing ability bug.
	   MOB REGEN is being tweaked a little to find a good value,
	   please bear with us as this code is being playtested and
	   feedback is very welcome.

03-26-01 : Made mobs flee a little bit less insanely now, and also
	   fixed it so their fears turn into hatreds correctly.
	
03-26-01 : Reworked some of the damage rates vs blunt for fabric
	   material types.  Feedback welcome.

03-26-01 : Mob were healing a bit during fights while PCs were not.
	   Whoops.  Mobs no longer heal during fights, but they also
	   heal faster when not fighting.

03-26-01 : The way mobs track has been adjusted slightly.  They track
	   slower at all levels, but at higher levels they track
	   through more rooms each tick.

03-26-01 : Fixed a slight hosing of yoginsa. This is still not totally
           correct so it is subject to minor change.

03-25-01 : Fixed some rounding errors in prac and hp gains.

03-20-01 : Fixed a slight problem in the way karma was being worked
	   into crit hit rates.

03-20-01 : Reworked HP and practice gaining formulas.  Its hard to
	   say exactly what the result of these changes will be,
	   because of the nature of the previous formulas.

03-20-01 : Fixed a rather large inconsistancy in the way stats were
	   factored into gameplay.  The problem affected only your
	   sub par stats, and in a negative way.  Thus, this change
	   will help you.

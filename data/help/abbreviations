<h> allows virtually anything you type to be abbreviated.  For
example, if you wanted to tell Beelzebub 'hi', you need not type:
	tell beezlebub hi
But instead can get away with:
	tell beezl hi

Any mobile, person or object name can be abbreviated in most
situations and commands. Be careful though, to not abbreviate too 
much. Typing 'tell b hi' might tell Beatrice hi instead of Beelzebub. 
Always try to use an abbreviation that will make sure your command is 
done correctly.

until you encounter your first CITyguard and quickly realize the danger
abbreviations can cause...

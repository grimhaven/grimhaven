Pets are defined as a being that follows the will of a master.  These include
but are not limited to mage and shaman thrall/charms, animals sold by pet
stores, and hypnotized or ensorcered beings. 

Pets are a frill of the game.  They are in no way guaranteed to do exactly what
you want when you want.

Pets are indeed a frill and do NOT fall under any reimbursal guidelines for loss.
This means that you use a pet AT YOUR OWN RISK.  If you lose a pet to a mud crash
and the pet is holding or wearing equipment or talens for you, sorry, your out of
luck.

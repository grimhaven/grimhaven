Syntax: scan {direction}

The scan command will let you look 'into' rooms that are linearly
adjacent to you.  You can scan either in a direction, or in general.
Scanning with no parameters will cause you to look in all ten directions.
Scanning in a <direction> will cause you only to scan in that direction.

Scan range is a function of your eyesight and is modified for the amount
of clutter in the way.  Eyesight is a function of natural vision, age
and is modified both for race (elven is quite good), as well as for height
(being able to see over things helps).  Clutter is measured in terms
of how dense the terrain (forest vs. plains) as well as modified for things
already seen that block further vision.  Certain spells also contribute.

Scans will show you creatures and items visible within your scan range as
well as their relative range from you.

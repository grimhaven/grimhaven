Sharpeners are weapon smiths skilled in returning the edge to a blade,
restoring the point to a weapon or smoothing a weapon's surface.  In short,
they improve the quality of the weapon.  (Do not confuse this with a
weapon's structure which represents the durability of the item.  See help
repair shops)

Weapons that have low quality will do less damage, and are less likely to
lop off limbs, behead, etc.  The best way to see a weapon's quality is to
look at it.
syntax: look <weapon>

Cutlery shops will return your weapon to full quality for a modest fee in
a short amount of time (while'U-wait).  Valid commands at a cutlery shop:

VALUE <weapon>     : will show you how much it will cost to fix the weapon.
GIVE <weapon> <sharpener>    : hands the weapon to the sharpener for fixing.
                               Payment is automatic.

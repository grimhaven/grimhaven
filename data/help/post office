The post office is an important room in any major town as it provides
you with the ability to contact any other player in the mud.  If you
send someone mail, as soon as they log in, they will be told that they
have mail waiting and can pick up your message.

Most major towns have post offices.

<h>'s mail system is compliments of Rasmussen of the now defunct
CircleMUD and also defunct JediMUD.

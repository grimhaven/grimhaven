Syntax: light <light source> {room | held}

The light command is used to light a light source or, under the right
circumstances, light an object on fire.

The optional second argument is used to distinguish between objects in the room
and those equipped by the player.  If not specified, the command will look for
an object in the room first.

For example, if one lantern were on a table in the room and a player had
another in their hand, 'light lantern'  or 'light lantern room' would light the
lantern on the table and 'light lantern held' would light the equipped lantern.

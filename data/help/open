Syntax: open <something>

Open pretty much does what it says, it opens something.  It is appropriate
to use this on a wide variety of things: bags, chests, doors, portals,
gates, desks, wine skins, etc.

If the item is an object of some sort, you may use standard referencing
format to differentiate multiple, similar objects.
eg.
open 1.chest		open chest large
open 2.chest 		open chest small
open 3.chest 		open 2.chest small

Exits may be differentiated by doing:
open door north 	open door wooden 
open door east		open door steel
open door sw		open door large
Not all exits are opened through the exit command, sometimes something 
mechanical must be manipulated to operate these exits.

Note that opening some things may cause a trap to go off.  It pays
to have a thief examine suspicious devices.

Open will try and determine what you mean if you give it an ambiguous target.
That is, it will attempt to open the first <something> that is openable and not
presently open already that it can find.

Lore is the discipline of self discipline and knowledge attainment. 
Through internal reflection and concentration, a caster can learn to
commune with the primal forces and increase his general power.  Although
in part it consists of legends, tales of historic conquests, and learning
the magic properties of things, it is mostly about learning to study and
concentrate.

Learned users of magic rely on this discipline heavily due to its tried
and tested theories that have been passed down through the ages, from
generation to generation.  What once was believed to be fireside
fairy-tales has become a significant field of study in the ways of magic. 
Lore may be learned in combination with, or exclusive of, the more
physically demanding skill of combat to obtain a state of learning
attractive to higher trainers.

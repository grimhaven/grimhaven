Syntax: toggle terminal <arguments>

This command allows players to change their terminal type and
screen size from within the game. 

Valid arguments to use with the terminal command are :
1) Ansi
   Syntax : toggle terminal Ansi
   This will put you in Ansi terminal mode, with a status
   bar at the bottom of your screen.

2) VT100
   Syntax : toggle terminal VT100
   This will put you in VT100 terminal mode, with a status
   bar at the bottom of your screen.

3) none
   Syntax : toggle terminal none
   This will take you out of either Ansi or VT100 terminal
   mode and put you back in regular mode.

4) screensize
   Syntax : toggle terminal screensize <number>
   Number is the number of lines your screen has. Your
   screen size is used anytime that a function sends a
   PRESS RETURN message, to determine how many lines to
   send between each PRESS RETURN message. It is also used
   to determine where on the screen to put your status bar
   in Ansi or VT100 mode.

5) account
   Syntax : toggle terminal account <Ansi | VT100 | none>
   This changes your accounts terminal mode.  The account's terminal mode
   determines what the default terminal type will be for your characters as
   well as whether the main menu and title screens are colorized.

Additional toggles that affect your terminal include:

1) boss
   Syntax: toggle boss
   Turns boss-mode on/off for all characters in your account.  Boss mode
   causes suppression of the ASCII login screens.  Please note that this
   also suppresses the listing of the options, so you should have some
   familiarity with the game before you make this active.

2) MSP
   Syntax: toggle MSP
   Toggles MUD Sound Protocol, MSP, on and off.  You will need to be using a
   MSP capable client to take advantage of MSP.

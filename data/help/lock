Syntax: lock <something>

Lock pretty much does what it says, it locks something.  The item must be
lockable and you must possess the proper key to unlock the item.  It is
appropriate to use this on a wide variety of things: chests, doors, portals,
gates, desks, etc.

If the item is an object of some sort, you may use standard referencing
format to differentiate multiple, similar objects.
eg.
lock 1.chest		lock chest large
lock 2.chest 		lock chest small
lock 3.chest 		lock 2.chest small

Exits may be differentiated by doing:
lock door north 	lock door wooden 
lock door east		lock door steel
lock door sw		lock door large

Lock will try and determine what you mean if you give it an ambiguous target.
That is, it will attempt to lock the first <something> that is lockable and not
presently locked already that it can find.

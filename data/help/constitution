Constitution represents a player's strength of character and physical
endurance.

In game terms, constitution is heavily used in regeneration formulas
(how fast health is restored) as well as a bonus number of points in
the hit points received at leveling time.  It also determines a player's
shock resistance to major blows which can both prevent critical effects
and reduce damage.

Since the dawn of The World, the Faeries have taken an interest in its
development.  The elves are their descendents, the gnomes their creation,
and many of the other races are the creations of the gnomes.  All along,
various influences and tinkerings have taken place and continue even to this
day.  As a result, some individuals are weakened and cast away.  Others find
greater strengths than the common stock.  These rare individuals, both
blessed and cursed, are known as Fae-Touched.  You have the option of
creating a character of the ilk blessed with greater gifts.  Be warned,
however, that such individuals tend to take their gifts for granted and
blame their mistakes on others.  As a result, they learn rather slowly.
The special abilities of these offshoots also tend to be rather random.

Fae-Touched is a creation option available to players who have at least one
level 50 character in their account.  It allows them to make a special new
character of the same race as that level 50 character or characters.  Perma 
death characters are a special case:  only having at least one level 50 perma
death character of the appropriate race will unlock this option for new
perma death characters.

If you select the Fae-Touched option the character will have bonus stat
points distributed randomly upon creation.  You will get more points for
each applicable level 50 character in your account.  However, the character
will gain experience at half the normal rate.

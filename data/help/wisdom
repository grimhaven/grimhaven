Wisdom represents a player's practical knowledge.  It reflects their
"common sense" or experience as opposed to intelligence.

Wisdom is closely related to intelligence, one being what has been
learned from training (int), the other learned by doing (wis).  It
is widely used whenever a "smartness" check needs to be made.  It is also
important in determining just how fast you learn when doing a skill.
Those with above average wisdom will tend to learn a skill much faster
when they start doing it, since they will pick up on their mistakes
faster and correct them.

Akodi is one of numerous oriental martial arts.  While not heavily used in
this part of The World, certain monks are adept in its use.  Akodi is the
best known of the oriental armed combat styles.  It differs from weapon's
training in this part of The World principally in the types and scope of
weapons taught.  The effective use of martial-art weapons is the principal 
goal.

The chief advantage of martial art weapons is that it permits the trained
Akodian to combine information gleaned from Kubo and Oomlat Philosophy with
their weapon skills.  This effectively means they can do more then one attack
with a martial-art weapon (Oomlat) or do additional damage (Kubo).

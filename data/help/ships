For those players that have obtained control of a ship with a captain 
there are several useful commands available to exploit the captain's 
abilities. These are employed by simply speaking the command:

<c>Captain, destination<1>
        The captain will list out all known destinations.

<c>Captain, destination <destination><1>
        Saves the current location as a new destination.

<c>Captain, forget <destination><1>
        Removes a destination from the list of known locations.

<c>Captain, <sail | cruise> <destination> <destination>...<1>
        Sail for the requested destination. If more than one is listed, 
        the captain will sail to each destination in the order requested.
        If the <c>cruise<1> option is used instead of <c>sail<1>, the captain will 
        sail in a loop of all requested destinations.

<c>Captain, go <slow | medium | fast><1>
        The captain will change the speed of the ship.

<c>Captain, stop<1>
        The captain will stop the ship and clear the current destination.

<c>Captain, take five<1>
        The captain will stop the ship and hand over the ship's "key", 
        allowing the player to control the ship directly with the <c>drive<1>
        command.

<c>Captain, obey<1>
        List out the players which have been given limited permissions to 
        control the captain.

<c>Captain, obey <player name><1>
        Give limited control to another player, i.e. a "guest commander".

<c>Captain, ignore <player name><1>
        Remove the named player's privileges (player must be online).

Players with control via the <g>obey<1> option will not be able to alter 
the list of known destinations, the list of "guest commanders" or to force 
the captain to hand over control of the ship.

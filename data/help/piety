Piety represents the internal store of energy with which a cleric or deikhan
prays.  All prayers require some piety to be consumed, the exact amount
depends on the supplicant's level and how powerful the desired prayer is.

All supplicants, regardless of level, are limited to a maximum piety of 100.0
points.  Although as indicated above, the piety cost per prayer decreases as
the supplicant gains in power.

Regeneration of piety depends on both the relative power of the supplicant's
deities (in relation to other deities) as well as how worthy the supplicant is
in the eyes of their deities.  If the deity's power is below average, the
deity may refuse to regenerate the piety of supplicants that have not been
living up to the deity's ideals.  Conversely, a very powerful deity will grant
tremendous regeneration to a very devout supplicant.

Unaffiliated players will regenerate piety at a fixed rate.  This rate is below
what it would be for an affiliated player, but ignores the fluxuating power
of the various deities.

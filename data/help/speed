Speed is how fast a character can react to what is happening.
In gaming terms, speed has two primary benefits.  The first is initiative,
and the second is recovery.

Initiative relates to those things where being faster gives you an
advantage.  For example, the combatant with the higher speed gets to
hit first in combat.

Recovery relates to the speed at which you are able to perform an
action, and be prepared to do your next action.  This is primarily
evidenced in skill, spell and prayer usage.  For instance, a slow
player may require 4 rounds to perform a kick, while a fast player
might be able to do it in 2.5.  Things with a recovery time take
speed into account.

Syntax: attack <mode>

The attack command is used to change your mode of attack. As of now
you can choose from offense, defense, and normal. 

NORMAL		:  no bonuses tohit, no detriments to armor
OFFENSE		:  You will hit monsters more easily, and be hit by them
                   more easily in return.
DEFENSE		:  You will be hit less often but also hit monsters less
                   often.

Newbie note: fight aggressively!  Defensive mode prolongs the fight and
in a 1-on-1 fight, you will most likely take more damage than you would
otherwise.  Defensive mode pays off if you have group mates or are highly
armored/skilled though.

Syntax: bug

This will drop you into a simple editor similar to the in-MUD mail system.

Type ~ and return on a blank line to send your bug, or ` on a blank line to
cancel your bug report.

Typically, BUGS are obvious unintended problems for the game.  Use IDEA for
suggestions, TYPO for typos and REQUEST for all other help requests.

Bug reports display who gave the report as well as where in the game the bug
is being reported from, so this information can be left out of a report.

We appreciate the reporting of bugs, this allows us to improve the quality of
the game.  It is expected that once a bug is known the player will report the
bug and refrain from using it to their advantage.

Alternatively, you may visit http://www.sneezymud.com/Contact_Us.html and fill
out the web form to report your bug.

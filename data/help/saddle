Syntax: saddle <horse> <saddle>

Saddle will put <saddle> onto <horse>'s back so that it might be ridden
more easily.  Saddles dramatically increase a rider's chance of staying
mounted under adverse conditions such as combat.  You must have the <saddle>
in your inventory.

Saddlebags and paniers or packs may also be saddled onto a mount, and thier
inventory can be accessed using GET <obj> <horse> and PUT <obj> <horse>.

Objects stored this way are subject to loss over a crash, and are not
subject to reimbursment.

Some saddlebags can be used as a saddle as well.

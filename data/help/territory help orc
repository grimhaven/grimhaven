As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
by your racial selection.  Territorial selection serves as a modifier
on these natural stats.  So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race
here that will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm. 

Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
game.  However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly
by your choice of background.  The chief effect of territorial
choice is to modify your natural racial stats.

Streetwise Orc: Your clan is powerful enough to control a city and you are one
of the denizens littering the streets.  Your glib tongue and wit have kept you
alive and healthy, but you havent had the physical trials that a battle-tested
orc must overcome every day.

Skirmish Orc: You and your small clan survive as a small raiding party of
ambushers or skirmish fighters.  Someday you hope to make a name of your clan
and rise to control a city, but for now your close-knit clan ties are all you
have.

Lone Orc: You were raised mostly alone.  Your clan was mostly killed either
in a labor camp or a battle.  You and a few others are all that remain.  You
have developed the skill and determination to survive, but lack many social
skills.

Boulder Orc: You grew up in a labor camp who toiled with stonecutting and
hauling for machines of war.  Your entire life has consisted of heavy physical
labor with little or no rest.  You are strong and healthy, but lack even a basic
education.

Deforester Orc: You grew up in a logging troupe with other orcs and goblins.
You spent spent much of your early years moving around, stripping the forest of
lumber and resources.  You have both an appreciation of the power that can be
extracted from nature, and how to subsist in the woods.  You have some contact
with weaker civilizations, but only to take their land and resources.

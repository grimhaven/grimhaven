Syntax: look

The look command is useful for studying your surroundings or for examining
something in detail.  Look with no parameters will cause you to take another
peek at the present room you are in.

======================================================
Syntax: look room

The "look room" command is used to force a look at the room description and is
most handy when brief mode is being used.

======================================================
Syntax: look <direction>

Looking in a <direction> will show you as much information as can easily be
discerned about what lies off in that direction.

======================================================
Syntax: look <something>
Syntax: look at <something>

The following syntaxes are all equivalent:
   look at <something>
   look <something>
   examine <something>

The obvious details of <something> will be revealed.

In most shops, you may look at the shopkeeper's inventory.  This is done
by doing look <obj> or look <item #>.

The order of precedence for look <x> is the following:  1. Mobs, 
2. Inventory objects, 3. Worn Objects, 4. Room Objects, 5. Room Extra
Descriptions.  This should work similar to other object manipulation
functions.

======================================================
Syntax: look in <something>

The contents of a container may be displayed by looking in them.  

The special case "look in all.corpse" is supported.  Contents of all corpses
in the room will be revealed.

======================================================
Syntax: look through <something>

Some objects may be looked through.  Windows, telescopes, and the like are
good examples.

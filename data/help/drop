Syntax: drop <something>
Syntax: drop <"hold-left" | "hold-right">

Drop does basically what it sounds like, it causes you to drop a piece
of your inventory.  Needless to say, dropped objects will turn up on the
ground of where they are dropped (or plummet earthward if you happen to
be flying).

Note that certain places (dumps, junkyards, etc) are so cluttered that
anything dropped is absorbed into the general clutter and thus lost forever.

Also note that mobs tend to be greedy and have been known to pick up
anything they find of use to them on the ground.

Drop can also be used to drop held items without first removing them.  Please
note, unlike most other commands, <something> will be looked for in your
inventory before checks are made on held items.

Variations:
drop all		: drops everything in your inventory
drop all.bottle		: drops anything with the name bottle in it
			Abbreviations apply, so anything that "bottle"
			is an abbreviation for will also be dropped
drop 9*bottle		: drops the first 9 bottles in your inventory
drop 9.bottle		: drops the ninth bottle in your inventory

There is no reimbursement for dropped items if the mud crashes or for
errors in what item was dropped by you.

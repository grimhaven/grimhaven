Syntax: drag <object|person> <direction>

Drag allows a person to move the incapacitated or unconscious out of harm's
way or to a place where they may be mended.  The <person> must be sleeping
or otherwise unconscious and the person attempting the drag must be fairly
strong.  Note that drag can cause added damage to <person> and/or infections
to begin in already open wounds so should only be done with good cause.

If a person slips unconscious in a no-magic area, drag may be their only
hope of survival.

Note that drag is NOT an aggressive act as it assumes that anyone that
can be dragged is incapable of protest.  Nor is it a skill, for similar
reasonings.

Drag also works on objects, such as corpses.

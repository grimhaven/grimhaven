Most major towns have banks.  The central bank of Grimhaven is the largest
depository of cash in all the civilized lands.  Money deposited in the
bank is safe from thieves, but there is a limit as to how much the bank
is willing to store for you (level dependent).

Additionally, the banks have a standing agreement with the innkeeper's
guild.  Should your on-hand cash ever run out as you stay in rent, the
banks will foot the bill drawing from your account as necessary.

Banks also serve as the repository of a faction's treasury.  You may make
deposits to your faction's treasury with the tithe command.

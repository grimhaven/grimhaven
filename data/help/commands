Syntax: commands
Syntax: commands -<letter>

Displays all accessible commands you can execute.

Since there are a large number of possible commands, it may be worthwhile
to specify the first <letter> of the commands you are interested in.  i.e.,
to see all commands beginning with the letter x, you would enter:
    command -x

So typing command -ab would list out every command you have that starts
with a or b.

Syntax: brief

Toggles "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you do not see the description of
the room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people and objects 
present will be shown.  Brief mode also affects how exits are displayed.

Unless you are very familiar with the surroundings in which you travel, it
is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find small, but
vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: an extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death.

You can force a look at the room's description while brief mode is on by using
the "look room" command.

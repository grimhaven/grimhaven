Mages are practitioners of magic of a wide variety of uses.  While they
have a certain control over nature through the use of magic, the cost
in time, mana and materials often makes such control impractical or less
effective than direct control.  eg. why summon a minor fire elemental
to light your candle when a match is at hand?  Nor has the art of magic
advanced to the state where it surpasses what a deity can cause via
direct divine intervention.  Nevertheless, magic and the mages that wield
it are definitely a force to be reckoned with.

Mages have the following basic disciplines:
Combat, Lore, Mage Abilities, Adventuring, Pierce Specialization, Wizardry

Mages have the following specialization disciplines:
Air Magic, Earth Magic, Fire Magic, Water Magic, Sorcery, Spirit Magic,
Alchemy

Before practicing at an advanced/specialized discipline, the mage must
learn mage abilities fully and have a combined learning in lore and/or
combat of 100.

The faith discipline deals with various ways that a cleric or deikhan
show their allegiance to the appropriate deities.  Increased learning
in this discipline has the benefit of making prayers easier to accomplish. 
A cleric's or deikhans faith increases by level and it affects where he
must have his holy symbol.

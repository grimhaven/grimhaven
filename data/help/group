Grouping allows multiple people to coordinate their activities.  In order
to group someone, they must be following you.  Anyone who is following you
may be grouped, but you must be grouped yourself first.  To ungroup someone,
type "group <person>" again.  To disband the entire group, ungroup yourself.
The <all> or <followers> parameter will allow you to add any person following
you but not already grouped to be grouped; this is useful in large, confusing
groups.

Grouping allows all party members to share experience points for kills while
grouped.  Additionally, the gtell (group tell) command is available for all
group members.

Group with no parameters will display who is in the group.  The present
condition and present share is also displayed for each group member that 
is in the room.

The group leader may set the individual shares for various party members in
the leader's group.   Only PCs may have their shares set.  <amount> should
be a number between 1 and 10 shares.  Realize that when a split occurs, the
amount split will be divided by the total number of shares (rounded down).
Thus, if the group's total shares is greater than the amount split, each
share will be zero talens.  Note that these shares only apply to talens
(when split), not to xp. 

If the group leader dies while the group is formed, the group will reform
on the last member of the group to follow the leader.

The "seeksgroup" parameter acts as a toggle that will cause (Seeks Group) to
be appended to your display when people use the WHO command.

The "lots" parameter will cause lots to be thrown, choosing 1 group member.

The "amtank" parameter will give those highly skilled in switch and rescue
tactics a chance to block a mob's attempt to switch to someone else in their
group while the person flagged "amtank" is tanking.

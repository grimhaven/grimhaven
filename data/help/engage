Engage is a way to enter into a fight without physically 
attacking the mob.  If engage is used to start a fight, the
mob engaged will still physically attack the PC it is engaged
in battle with.

Engage is handy for magic users that wish to save their 
concentration and focus for their prayers, spells or rituals
without being as distracted by physical combat.

Players may choose to disengage from the fight by using the 
"disengage" command.  To begin physically attacking the
opponent, use the "hit" command.

Toggling engage on will cause you to enter engaged mode during
any fight you start.

Toggling engage-all on will cause you to enter engaged mode
during any fight, including those started by aggressive mobs.

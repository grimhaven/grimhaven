Official PvP Policy:

Player killing and player looting are prohibited.  Intentional player
killing	or player theft	will result in penalties for the player	killer or
looter and reimbursement for the victim. In other words, it won't even be
worth your time	to break this rule.

The TOGGLE NOHARM flag will prevent you from intentionally inflicting damage   
on another player character.

For those wishing to spar, find	an arena in which to battle or request a  
special	event duel or PeelPK event from	the quest god.

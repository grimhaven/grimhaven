Lifeforce is the essence of a persons soul. This essence is needed
by a Shaman in order to do day to day activities. There are only
very few ways to gain lifeforce.

     1. Direct combat when limb damage is issued.
     2. Sacrificial ritual.
     3. Draining spells/skills.

Lifeforce is considered to be a Shamans power and life's blood. A
Shaman that does not pay attention to the tasks of gathering lifeforce
from beings of the world will suffer greatly. A Shaman can even die 
from a lack of life's essence. 
Lifeforce will be used in the performance of rituals. Rituals vary
from situation to situation.

Lifeforce MUST be maintained. If you are above level 5 and have 0 lifeforce,
the natural drain will directly affect your health (hitpoints).

<R>WARNING:<z> This is not to be taken lightly by a Shaman. The results
         of ANY lack of activity can be fatal.

Syntax: fill <container> {other container}

Fill allows you to move liquid from {other container} to <container>.
In general, <container> must be in your inventory, but {other container}
in certain cases need not be.  The {other container} parameter may be
omitted if there is a large source of liquid immediately available (ie.
fountain, lake, pond, stream, river...).  Fill will attempt to put as
much of {other container}'s contents into <container>, filling it if
possible.

You are able to fill <container>s from natural sources of freshwater
such as rivers and streams.

Mixing liquid types (water and wine for instance) will lead to a yucky,
disgusting sludge that is best not drunk.

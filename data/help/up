To move in a given direction, these commands may be employed.  Most folks
find it significantly easier to use the 1 or 2 letter abbreviations
however: N, E, S, W, U, D, NE, NW, SE, SW

Note that movement requires the ability to move as well as a valid place
to move into.  Hence, things like broken limbs, paralyzation, bad position
(resting, sitting...), etc may prevent you from trying to move or cause
other effects in the attempt to do so.  Additionally, the place you are trying
to go must be ok.  Low ceilings, tight rooms and the like are common
impediments to movement.

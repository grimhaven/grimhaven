Syntax: get <object> {container}

The get and take commands are synonymous and are used to move <object>
into your inventory.  If the {container} parameter is skipped, it is
assumed that <object> is on the ground in the room.

Note that when you kill a creature, its corpse becomes a {container} for the
items it had before it died.  Hence "get <object> corpse" is valid.

Obviously, you need to possess the strength (for weight) and dexterity (for
volume) to carry the <object> in order to succeed.

Variations:
get sword		: gets a sword off the ground
get sword bag		: gets a sword out of a bag
get all			: gets everything off the ground
get all.sword		: gets everything for which sword is an abbreviation
get 9*sword		: gets the first 9 swords in the room
get 9.sword		: gets the ninth sword in the room

Minor wishes are typically granted as the result of the completion of a
small, relatively "simple" quest where the quest difficulty was rated at
average.  They can only be granted by the god who set up and ran the 
quest.  Typical minor wishes might include:

--creation of some existing piece of equipment.
--creation of wealth.
--item resizing at deity's discretion.
--some combination of the above

Quality of the wish is dependent on difficulty of the quest.  Wish 
phrasing is important... asking for a million coins might get you buried
alive under an avalanche of coins falling from the sky.  Asking for
things beyond the power of the wish might burn-out and use up the wish
making it useless.  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

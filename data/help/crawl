Syntax: crawl

Crawling makes you get down on your hands and knees and begin to crawl.
Once you start to crawl, anytime you move you will crawl in that direction.
To stop crawling, merely stand back up.

Crawling has the advantage that you can enter a room with a smaller ceiling 
without risk of bumping your head, but it takes a good deal more vitality
to move about in this method.  Crawling can also be advantageous if one of
your legs is not functioning properly, although having a bum arm can negate
this as well.

It is not possible to crawl while not on land (flying, swimming, underwater).
While most abilities that a standing person is capable of are permissible to
a crawler, certain things do still require you to first stand up.  Fighting
from the crawling position, while possible, is remarkably less effective.

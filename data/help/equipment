Syntax: equipment damaged

The equipment command will print out what pieces of armor, weapons,
or other knick-knacks you happen to be using at the moment.  It will
also display critical limb damage.  If insufficient light is present to
see an item, it may not be displayed.

With the "damaged" parameter, only damaged pieces of equipment will be listed.

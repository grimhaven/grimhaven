Vampirism is a condition that causes a dead body to remain animated.
This is similar zombieism, except that the person remains conscious,
self aware and intelligent.  Also unlike zombies, vampires are not
subject to bodily decay.  Vampires are often considered the pinnacles
of undead culture and power.

Vampires are known to be unusually strong and agile and to be mentally
focused.  They can go invisible at will and can see through any
darkness without effort.

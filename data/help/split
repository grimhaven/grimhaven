Syntax: toggle split

Split will take <amount> and divide that amount of your talens among all
current group members giving 1 share to each person (including yourself).

Split can be used to make one hide into a few smaller ones, but this will 
also cause some of the hide to be lost in the process.

Split can also be used to separate a spell component into two.  This new
component will have the number of charges specified.

Turning the split toggle on will cause you to automatically split all
talens you acquire with the rest of your group.

The who command will display all players who are presently connected and
active.  You must be able to see in order to view the who list (blindness,
or darkness may prevent).

With no parameters, it will list everyone.  The -? flag will list the
available flags.  

Specifying, who <name> will list some info about <name> if they are active, 
additionally, it will list anyone with <name> as an abbreviation.  Hence,
"who joe" would display "Joe", "Joey" and "JoeBlow".

Specifying, who <level> will list out all players at or above <level>.
Specifying, who <level1> <level2> will list out all players between the two
levels, inclusive.

The flags are as follows, and may be combined:
parameters:		b - builders (level 51s)	g - gods
o - mortals		l - levels			q - questers
p - groups              z - seeksgroup

e - elves               u - humans                      r - ogres
w - dwarves             t - hobbits                     n - gnomes

For example :
who -l		: lists out everyone by their levels
who -el		: lists out all elves as well as their levels
who -le 	: same as who -el

A (Seeks Group) will be appended if that person has toggled that group option
on.  See the group command help file to see how to set this option.

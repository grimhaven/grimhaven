Syntax: transform <limb>
Currently Supported Limbs: Hands, Head, Arms, Neck, Legs 

A dedicated player is able to harness the power of the chameleon to
transform certain of his or her limbs own limbs into those of various
animals. The limbs allow the player certain abilities but also restrict
the player in various ways. 

Currently, the following limbs are supported: arms, legs, hands, neck, and
head.  The transformability of a limb depends on both the level and
learningness of a player.  When cast the players limbs will transform, all
equipment on those limbs transformed may suffer damage or destruction. 

Transformed limbs last for a period of time or a player can transform
specific limbs (or all) back by using return <limb names> or by returning
all. In addition, the limbs require connection with the outdoors.
Equipment is forbidden to the transformed limb and they will only survive
outdoors or in water.  One can fight with a transformed limb although some
of one's fighting ability may be limited by the abilities of the limb and
the lack of equipment may restrict the player's abilities further.

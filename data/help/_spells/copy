The copy spell will transfer the magical words on any scroll to a new
scroll, thus making a duplicate of the original.  The Independent
Consortium of Scroll Dealers will not deal in copied scrolls, so the
new variety typically has little worth on the scroll market.

The caster must know the spell that is on the scroll for this to work.

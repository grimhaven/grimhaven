Easily one of the most destructive forms of magic known to thaumaturgy.
Meteor swarm requires a great control over all forms of earth-magic in
order to cause celestial bodies to plummet toward the ground and crush
an enemy.  Even the smallest of meteors will travel fast enough to kill
all but the most hardy of enemies.  The number and size of meteors is
dictated by the mage's level.  This spell has no effect unless there is
sky overhead.

Tree walk allows the ranger to hone in on the lifeforce of great, ancient trees
and transport the ranger to that location.  The spell is greatly taxing both
on the ranger as well as the tree that is focused in upon.  Only certain trees
have the necessary lifeforce to serve as anchors for this spell.

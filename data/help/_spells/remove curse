Remove curse will remove a deity's hex from off of a victim or object, freeing
it of any geas.  While some effects of a curse are permanent, this will remove
what affects it can from the target.

Remove curse, if invoked upon a creature, will remove the curse affecting
the creature.  If no curse is present on the creature, the prayer will
remove the curse on one of the creature's worn or held items.

The fly spell grants the power of flight to the recipient.  It requires that
the recipient be standing and can not be cast underwater.  Flying creatures
gain all the advantages of levitation as well.  

Typical duration depends on the air mage's level, but also varies depending
on the flyer's weight.

Remember that 'flight' merely grants the power of flight to the intended
recipient.  You actually have to 'fly' in order to take off.

Flare is one of the few utility spells in a fire-mages inventory.  It
creates a globe of fire to hover high in the air to light the room.
The globe does slowly fall, although it can be fired high enough that
it would require weeks to fall back to the ground.  The light output
from the globe is dependent on the caster's power.  Flares should
only be fired where there is adequate clearance for the flare; using
them indoors is a dangerous pastime.  Finally, the fire elementals
bound to create the flare are very competitive; having two flares
in the sky simultaneously is not permitted.

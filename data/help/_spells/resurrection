The ritual resurrection is a very draining ritual to the shaman. The ritual
will cost the shaman a monetary offering to the loa of 2500 talens. The 
component needed in this ritual is also very expensive and hard to come by.
The resurrected corpse, if the shaman is powerful enough, will become the
servant of the houngan. Otherwise on success the victim of the ritual will
have its life restored. The resurrection of player corpses is not supported.

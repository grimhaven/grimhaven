Blindness will prohibit a creature from seeing anything at all.  Creatures
that have been blinded will have problems hitting during combat, and are also
easier to score hits on.  Additionally, blinded creatures are less agile.  

The duration the creature is blinded for is dependent on the cleric's devotion,
but typically lasts a few hours.

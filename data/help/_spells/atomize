Atomize is the ultimate in destructive spells.  Derived from what was once
called the disintegrate spell, atomize is a second generation variation with
increased damage potential and a less obscure component; it has made the old
disintegrate spell totally obsolete.  Atomize will attempt to reduce the
victim to ash.

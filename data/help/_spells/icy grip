When cast, the magic user summons forth two disembodied hands that race toward
the victim and attempt to grab hold of them.  If the hands successfully grab
hold of the victim, the victim will suffer moderate damage and suffer from
an immense chill.  The chill is severe enough to drain the strength from the 
victim.

The victim has a chance to dodge the hands, although typically at least one
will grab hold of them.  Once grabbed, the victim will suffer the strength
loss for roughly 6 hours, but during this time will be immune from further
strength loss due to icy grips.  Extremely well cast spells can last up to 
12 hours.

The galvanize spell will cause an item's molecular bonds to tighten making
the item structurally stronger.  It may require successive castings to
make any appreciable difference in a given item's capabilities.  Failures
may have the reverse effect of what was desired.

Galvanize now requires a quest in order to begin using or practicing it.
At the appropriate time, your trainer in this skill will instruct you in

The suffocation spell strips the oxygen from the air around the victim's
lungs in order to bring about asphyxiation.  Death is not automatic, but
should the victim remain without oxygen long enough, they will most certainly
die.  Duration of the spell is dependent on the power of the caster, but
is rather short lived in even the best situations.

The polymorph spell permits the caster to transmogrify him or herself into
the form of various creatures of the wild.  The caster will take on the shape
and statistics of the creature, and gains the ability to use any of the
creatures abilities.

What creatures are valid polymorph targets is a closely guarded secret. 
The ability to transform into those creatures depends on the learning 
in the spirit discipline and will improve with general training in that 
discipline.  The caster can only polymorph once in a given time period and
then must recover the ability.

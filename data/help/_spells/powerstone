The ability to store up excess magical power for later usage was the greatest
achievement of the high-magi Quazifrene.  The ability requires that an opal
be used as a receptacle for the magical power.

The maximum strength of the powerstone is dictated by the carat weight of the
opal being used.  The current strength of a powerstone may be increased by
successive casting of the powerstone spell on the opal.  Hence, a 4 carat opal
could become a 4-strength powerstone but to do so would require 4 successive
castings of the spell.

The amount of magical energy a powerstone can hold is roughly 10 points of
mana per powerstone strength. Only a mage can charge a power stone.  Only 
one powerstone on the mage's person will contribute to the mana of the mage.

Recent improvements to the powerstone spell have been made by the arch-wizard
Mobatsu.  Though it was meant to be kept a secret and used only for his own
nefarious purposes, word has spread to mages across the land.  A mage may now
charge the powerstone once and keep it anywhere in their inventory and feel
the benefit of an overall increase in possible mana capacity.  This means, of
course, that the powerstone needs not be recharged repeatedly, and meditation 
alone is all that is required to regain full mana.

Though any mana using class may use a charged powerstone, learning the 
powerstone spell is required to charge one.  

The owerstone spell requires the mage to complete a quest in order to be
able to practice it.  At the appropriate time, the trainer will tell you what 
you must do in order to complete the quest.

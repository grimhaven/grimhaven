Infravision grants the ability to see heat sources in the dark to a creature.
Note that this means that they can detect the presence of creatures, but
determining what the creature actually is may be somewhat difficult.  Items
typically have no internal heat sources, so are undetectable via infravision.
Duration of the infravision may be as long as a full day, but time is
dependent on the caster's level.

Creation of water in a formerly empty liquid receptacle is one of a cleric's
most directly useful prayers.  The amount of water created is dependent on
the caster's level, but can be increased dependent on the humidity in the air.
Trying to fill a container that was partially filled with some other liquid
other than water typically just creates a mess.

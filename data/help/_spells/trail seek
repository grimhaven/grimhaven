Trail seek allows the earth-mage to grant the power of track upon the
recipient of this spell.  This power can be used by the recipient to
find a path to almost any creature in The World; the range is limited
by the level of the caster.  It has no affect on someone that is already
affected with the power.  Duration of this power is fairly short lived,
typically less than an hour.

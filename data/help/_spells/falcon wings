Falcon wings grant a limited ability to fly.  The downside is that the wings
last a shorter time than a true flight spell, and should the recipient
get into a fight, the wings immediately revert to their former shape and
the power of flight is lost.  Needless to say, many an unwise air mage has
forgotten the caveat about avoiding combat and has found himself becoming
quite acquainted with the affects of gravity.  It can not be cast underwater.

Typical duration is 90 minutes, but varies with the weight of the flier.

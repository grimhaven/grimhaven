The creeping doom spell is a powerful player ability that focuses
the raw power of nature onto a target.  Exact effects will vary 
greatly depending on skill of the player and the player's 
surroundings, but the effect of the spell always lasts for a while,
and always has a debilitating effect on the victim.

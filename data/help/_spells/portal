Deities, unrestricted by the normal laws of magic, are able to change the 
shape of reality in such a way that two normally remote regions are
connected as if they were but a footstep away.  Such a change is generally
called a portal, and a worthy cleric may beseech a deity to grant such
a connection for a brief span of time.

You can only open a portal to a portal room.  Most major cities have
portal rooms.  ex pray portal grimhaven

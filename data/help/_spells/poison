A cleric may request that the deities drive fierce toxins into either a
piece of food or directly into a creature at hand with the intent to
induce eventual death.

Poisoned food or drink will induce poisoning in any creature imbibing of it.

Poisoned creatures will regenerate slower and suffer damage as time goes by.
Attempting to directly poison a victim is an aggressive act and the victim
has a chance of shaking off the effects.

Some creatures are immune to the effects of poisons.  The duration of the
toxins remaining in a creature's system is related to the level of the cleric
and may be as long as two entire days.

The ability to disperse the magical powers in another creature or object
is one of an alchemists more useful abilities.  Most magical affects
can be dispersed, although some creatures may become enraged by the loss
of their power.

The target of the dispel magic spell will make a saving throw (one per
effect) to preserve effects that are beneficial to that target.  Detrimental
effects are guaranteed to be removed.

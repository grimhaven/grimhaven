Sand blast is a further advancement of the pebble spray spell requiring
brief but strict control of a medium earth elemental.  This elemental
is forced to move hundreds of pounds of sand at a high velocity toward
the enemies.  Damage is moderate to heavy and afflicts all those not under
the protection of the casting mage.

The power to bend the undead to the shaman's purpose is a double edged
sword.  On the one hand, undead tend to be the most loyal of followers.
But on the flip side, the living followers that the shaman and in turn
the shaman's ancestors choose to attract tend to be afraid of such undead.
Use of these unliving followers is a risky business.

Not all undead may be controlled.  Duration of the control is level
dependent.

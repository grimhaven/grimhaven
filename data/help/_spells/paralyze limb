The paralysis of limbs is a cheap and quick way to subjugate all those that 
oppose the cleric's deities.  Paralyzed limbs do not function properly, if at
all, and will require special treatment to fix.

Paralyze limb is a more powerful variant of the numb prayer, but unlike its
weaker cousin, is permanent in duration.  Paralyzed limbs may be healed either
through treatment at a hospital, or with a restore limb prayer.

The immobilize spell binds the molecules around the victim and holds them
fast so that the victim is unable to attack.

An immobilized victim will suffer a combination of loss in melee swings, and
some combat lock-out.  Additionally, they will typically be knocked over and
cease fighting (allowing the mage to escape if necessary) unless hit again.

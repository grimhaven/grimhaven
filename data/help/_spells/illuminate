The illuminate spell causes an object to turn its material strength into
light.  The item will begin to glow, but the glow is fed by the strength of
the item which slowly dissipates.   Ultimately, the item will decay as
its strength is used up.

Magical items are too powerful to have this spell cast on them.  Sources
of light (lanterns, and the like) will also not work.  The candle power
of the illumination is dependent on the caster's level.

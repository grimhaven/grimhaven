Armor causes the recipient to be directly protected by the deity for a short
period of time, making them harder to damage in combat.  The duration of
this protection is dependent on the cleric's level, but typically lasts
less than half a day.  Deities provide greater protection if the target of
the prayer is the requesting cleric.

Multiply invoking the armor prayer will increase the duration it lasts.

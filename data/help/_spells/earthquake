Earthquakes are the most wide-spread destructive forces in nature releasing
their energy not just in a single location, but over entire regions.  Deity's
will sometimes bring about minor earthquakes to aid their loyal followers.
Earthquakes will typically cause anyone not flying to fall over and suffer
damage, although the damage decreases with distance from the epicenter.
A deity typically shields the cleric's group from the earthquake's effects.

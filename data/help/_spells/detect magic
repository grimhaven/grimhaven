Magical detection is a rather simple ability and can be granted to others
fairly easily by most alchemists.  Note that it only detects the presence
or absence of magical powers, not what powers may be present.  Also, it
is unable to detect invisible objects.  The ability typically lasts up to
2 days. Note that this spell should be cast upon the person you wish to grant
the power to detect magic; you should not cast it directly upon an item.

A virtual cloak of the shadows, this spell will make the shaman
into a shadow capable of walking through some barriers. The shaman
can only invoke the ritual upon his/herself. 

People with the power to see invisible beings can detect the shadow 
walking shaman.  The shaman will also lose the power to move invisibly
in rooms with few or no shadows.  Though you are a shadow most will 
not see you so difficulty with trade and commerce may apply. 

Be sure you want to become a shadow before invoking the ritual. Once
you become a shadow you will not be truely visable again until the
affects of the ritual disperse.

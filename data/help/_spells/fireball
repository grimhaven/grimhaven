Fireballs are actually minor fire elementals held captive.  They can be
thrown at an enemy and unleashed with powerful effect.  When released, the
elemental usually causes flame damage to anyone in the immediate area and
not just the target, although the casting mage has the power to protect
his group from damage.  Damage from a fireball is light to moderate
although it can cause items on the victim's body to burst into flame as
well.  Although of little real power, it is one of the more spectacular
forms of magic. 

This skill, in order to be first obtained, will require a quest.  The
quest will be started by the trainer of this skill at the appropriate
time.  Until this quest is completed, one will not be able to either
perform or practice it.

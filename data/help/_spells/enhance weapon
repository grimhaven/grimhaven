The enhance weapon spell is perhaps the most sought after ability an
alchemist can obtain.  When cast on a normal weapon, it can increase its
ability to hit and increase the amount of damage the weapon does in
combat.  It has no effect on items that are already magical.  The amount
of the increase is dependent on the power of the alchemist.

A high cleric can call on his gods to send a swarm of locusts on his
or her enemy.  The cost of this prayer is rather intense and a cleric
can only obtain one swarm at a time.  The swarm will last the duration 
of the battle so long as the caster is around to control the swarm.
The caster receives no experience for the damage the swarm does.

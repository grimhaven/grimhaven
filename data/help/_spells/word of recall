Word of recall beseeches the cleric's aid for refuge causing the cleric to
be relocated.  The effects of the relocation are dependent on how faithful
the cleric has been.  A truly loyal cleric will be brought home. If
unlucky, the cleric, may merely be placed at random somewhere in The
World. The success of this prayer is very dependent on how the cleric
serves his or her deity.  Deities have a terrible fate reserved for those
truly unloyal followers who place their fate in the deity's hands.

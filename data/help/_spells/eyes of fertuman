The High Alchemist Fertuman is said to have been able to locate any creature
or item in The World (and a few outside the realm of reality).  While she
took the secret to her grave with her, later aspirants were able to duplicate
her abilities to a lesser degree.  The range of the spell is limited by the
caster's power, and the vagaries of the magical arts will often reveal
unexpected targets.

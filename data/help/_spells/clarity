The spider in shaman allow for more clear vision through the
channeled thought process and the simplicity of the senses. The
spider can truly see things as they are. The spider knows its 
surroundings and the loa, in respect for this noble creature, have
bestowed this gift unto the shaman. Some magics such as invisibility
are too strong for the average spider to sense.

WARNING: The loa do NOT like the houngan to use their aid in conjunction
         with magical abilities of the same nature.

The Arch Water Magi Sarahage developed an advanced gills of flesh spell nearly
two centuries ago in a land far to the southeast.  Due to the secrecy that
spell casters maintain over their spellbooks, it has taken all this time for
the knowledge to come to the land of Grimhaven.  The breath will allow all 
those under the caster's protection to be able to breathe water for a similar 
duration as gills of flesh.

Realize though that the variation of Sarahage's breath that has made its
way into Grimhaven is an extremely unperfected one.  It is known to have
quirks, chiefly the fact that unlike gills of flesh, it is non-cumulative
in duration.  While perfected variations are known to exist, the exact
method required to perfect it is as yet unknown in Grimhaven, but 
experimentation continues within the labs of the Magi's towers.

Shapeshift gives the shaman the ability to assume the shape and abilities
of simple creatures.  The shape will only last a short while.

Methods to switch into the following creatures are known:
horsefly	slug		chicken		snake
dolphin		bear		crow 		hawk
spider

The ability to shapeshift into these creatures depends on the shaman's
level and learnedness in the discipline and spell. Each attempt at
shapeshift is draining to a shaman and may only be done once in a 
while.

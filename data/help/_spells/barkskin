Syntax: barkskin <player>

Long training in wood lore has shown rangers how to adapt plant-like
defenses to the human body, chief of which is the ability to make the skin
bark-like. While barkskinned, a creature's natural armor class is radically
improved, although the effect is best when the ranger employs it on him or
herself.  The duration is dependent on the caster's level, but is rarely
more than 9 hours. 

This skill, in order to be first obtained, will require a quest.  The
quest will be started by the trainer of this skill at the appropriate
time.  Until this quest is completed, one will not be able to either
perform or practice it.

Knowledgable clerics may invoke their deity to afflict a target with disease.  
The results of this prayer are not entirely predictable, but depending on the 
cleric's level the victim may suffer a simple cold, dysentery, influenza, 
pneumonia, leprosy or gangrene.  The strength and duration of most of these 
diseases is also dependent on cleric level.  Higher level victims may initially 
resist the more serious conditions.

Invisibility bestows the target with the gift of invisibility.  Invisible
creatures or items require special magic in order to be detected.  When cast
on an object, the effect is permanent until dispelled.  On creatures, the
duration is in the neighborhood of 12 hours.  Invisible creatures have a much
lower armor class.  Invisible creatures will lose their invisibility if they
enter combat.

Once affected by the spell of invisibility the target can switch to and from
the state through the use of the 'invisible' and 'visible' commands.  The
switching drains the duration so be wary.

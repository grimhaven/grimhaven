The magician Garmul spent many years attempting to create a spell that would
allow the mage to grow a fish tail for easier swimming.  His basic research
into the areas of polymorphism and water-magics earned him the respect of his
peers, but alas, Garmul died before she could complete her work.

It is said that on her deathbed, Garmul whispered a phrase to one of her
assistants that allowed the assistant to finalize this spell-variant.
While it does not create the fish tail, it does allow the recipient to move
with great ease through waters and other liquids.  In Garmul's honor, the
assistant named the spell after his mentor's life-long quest.

The duration of Garmul's tail is dependant on the caster's level.

The heal prayers will allow the cleric's deity to offer succor to the prayer's
target causing the restoration of lost hit points.  Each of the various prayers
returns a different amount of hit points based on the cleric's level.  

From least powerful to most powerful, the prayers are:
            heal-light, heal-serious, heal-critical, heal, heal-full 
There are also room-effective sprays that bring the benefit to all creatures in
the cleric's immediate vicinity.

The number of hit points returned is heavily dependent on the cleric's faction
rating and how closely the target and the cleric's beliefs coincide.

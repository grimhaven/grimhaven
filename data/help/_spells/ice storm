Ice storm will cause a swirling storm of ice and snow to twist about the caster
damaging all those in the vicinity not protected by the caster.  It is a more
advanced version of arctic blast, doing more damage to the victims.  Like
arctic blast, it too causes frost damage to exposed items.

Ice storm requires a quest be completed in order to either practice it or
perform it.  At the appropriate time, your trainer will tell you what you
must do in order to obtain this spell.

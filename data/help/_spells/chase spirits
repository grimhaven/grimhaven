The ability to disperse the evil spirits in another creature or object
is one of a houngans more useful abilities.  Most magical or ritualistic 
affects can be dispersed, although some creatures may become enraged by 
the loss of their power.

The target of the spirit expulsion will make a saving throw (one per
effect) to preserve effects that are beneficial to that target.  Detrimental
effects are guaranteed to be removed.

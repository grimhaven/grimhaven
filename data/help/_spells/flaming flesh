Flaming flesh was originally created by a team of semi competent
arch-firemages who were seeking to duplicate and improve the affects of
faerie fire using a different form of incantation.  While they made no
advancements in the understanding of magik, they did succeed in creating
an entirely new powerful spell with the opposite affect of faerie fire. 

Flaming flesh provides magical protection for the caster and makes the
caster harder to hit.  The limits of the spells are that no matter how
hard they tried the arch-mages were unable to make the spell castable on
others although it provides a powerful protection indeed for the caster. 
Duration of the spell is typically a day.

Flaming flesh is mutually exclusive with stone skin.

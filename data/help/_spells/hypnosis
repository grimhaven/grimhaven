Hypnosis allows the houngan to enslave a victim to the will of the 
houngan. While the victim doesn't have much hope of disobeying the
houngan while under the affects of hypnosis be warned that the 
victim, in no way, is a willing follower.

The duration of the hypnosis is dependant on the houngan's level,
charisma, and the immunity of the victim to charming affects.

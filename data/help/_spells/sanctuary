The powerful sanctuary protection will cause a deity to reduce all received
damage.  The degree of protection is dependent on the level of the cleric
invoking the prayer, but is typically at least 25%.  This can often mean
the difference between life and death in combat.  Duration of the protection
is 90 minutes.

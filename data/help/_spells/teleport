Since time immemorial, mages have longed for a magical means to transport
themselves across The World without effort.  The dictates of thaumaturgy
have proven unequivocally that the magical expenditure to do this is extremely
high.  While magical devices are known to exist that effect magical
transportation, they are generally restricted to large, immobile objects
with independent sources of magical power (portals and the like).

The best that a given mage may achieve, and even than at a tremendous use of
mana, is a teleportation where the destination is completely random and may
be dangerous or even fatal to the caster.

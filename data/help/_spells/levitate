Creatures granted the power of levitation will require less effort to
move and can safely travel over the surface of water without needing
to swim.  Creatures must be standing to be levitated, nor will this spell
have any affect on creatures already flying or levitating.  It can not
be cast while underwater.  Typical duration is 90 minutes.

Please realize that levitation does not equate with flying.  If there is
no ground beneath the levitater, they will still fall.  Levitation is simply
the ability to hover a few feet off the ground in order to ease travel and
cross rugged terrain more easily.

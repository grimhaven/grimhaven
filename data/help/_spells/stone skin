Stone skin blends the target's skin with a veneer of marble.  Such a
combination makes the target much more difficult to damage in combat.
Additionally, susceptibility to pierce attacks drops dramatically.
This benefit can last up to a full day.

Stone skin requires a quest in order to begin practicing this spell.  At
the appropriate time, the trainer of this spell will begin your quest and
tell you what you must do.  Until completion of this quest, you will not
be able to practice it or perform it.

Stone skin is mutually exclusive with flaming flesh.

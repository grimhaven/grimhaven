The hands of flame spell allows the fire mage to cause a minor fire elemental
to surround his hands while the mage touches his enemies.  This causes minor
flame damage to the enemy.  The target of this spell should correspond to
the creature you intend to attack.

Because the mage's hands are integral to this spell, lack of, missing, or 
severely injured hands will prevent this spell from succeeding.

Astral walk is a request of the deities to allow the cleric to traverse
great distances with but a single step.  How exactly the deities close
the distances between the target and the cleric has long been debated by
the best minds of magic, as the ability has yet to be duplicated by
thaumaturgy without a tremendous power expenditure.  Deities are notoriously
finicky about what areas they will allow access to, and regions that are
protected by other deities are often off limits.

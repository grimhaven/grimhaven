A devout cleric may beseech the deities to direct a bolt of lightning down
from the heavens to strike the cleric's foes.  Obviously, the cleric must
be outdoors and proper weather conditions must exist for lightning to
form, but when the situation is right, destruction of the cleric's foes is
virtually guaranteed.

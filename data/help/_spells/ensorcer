The ensorcer spell allows the caster to bind the victim to the caster's
will.  This is not a willing follower, although while under the effects of
the spell, the victim has no hope of disobeying the master's command.

The length of the ensorcery is dependent on the caster's level, the caster's
leadership ability and may be adjusted for the victim's resistance to charm.

Note that the caster must expend a mental effort both to bind the victim to
the caster's will, as well as maintain the control over time.

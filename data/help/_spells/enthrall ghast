The summoning of a ghast from the etherworld is very difficult and certinly
not without risks.  Beyond the initial expeniture of life force to bring the
ghast to the mortal realms, the shaman must feed the spectres need of life
force to continue its submissivness to the shaman.  It is also possible that
the ghast will be too powerful for a shaman to control, the effects of which
can prove deadly.

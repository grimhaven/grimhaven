Untreated wounds will sometimes become infected causing additional damage.  A 
cleric can cause this condition with a well timed prayer to the appropriate 
deities.  

Infected limbs do not regenerate as quickly and cause additional damage to the 
sufferer.  Left untreated, an infection will spread to other parts of the body.  
The body may defeat the infection, but there is often a race keep up with the 
spreading.

Cleric induced infections are typically accompanied by heavy bleeding at the 
infection's source.

Curse permits the cleric to imbue a character or an object with a powerful
geas.

A cursed object can not be dropped.  Additionally, if the item is a weapon, it
will permanently become worse off in terms of damage.  A curse on an object
is permanent.  A remove curse will allow the item to be dropped, but will
not repair the damage done to a weapon.

A cursed character will not hit as well in combat (fewer successful
hits, but same damage per hit), and will be more susceptible to paralyzation.
The curse on the character usually wears off naturally in 2 to 4 days.

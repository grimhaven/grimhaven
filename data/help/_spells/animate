Animate allows the sorcerer to create an automaton from a lifeless suit of
armor.  Gather together body armor, 2 boots, 2 leggings, 2 sleeves, 2 gloves
and a helm and cast the spell as the various pieces of armor lie on the ground.
The power of the automaton is dependent on the quality of the armor used to
create it.

The synostodweomer prayer allows the altruistic deikhan to transfer up to
half of the deikhan's present health to the target of the prayer. The deikhan
will lose the hitpoints given to the beneficiary.  The amount of hitpoints
transferred depends on the level of the recipient, the faction percentage
of the deikhan and the learning of the deikhan.  The prayer is very hard
to use and the deikhan can only use it about once every few days.

Salve is a perhaps the weakest of all healing prayers.  It will return lost
health points in the recipients wounded limbs but does not address any limb
afflictions.  Note that this is restoration of limb health, not hit points.
The number of health points returned is dependent on the cleric's level.  This
prayer is best regarded as preventative maintenance for limbs.

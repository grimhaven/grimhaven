The accomplished cleric or deikhan may be assisted by their deity to open the 
flesh of their foes and bleed them.  It is possible that several wounds will 
open at once.  The sufferer will sustain potentially deadly loss of health and 
damage to any affected extremeties.

The wounds can be treated with the same methods used for any other cut or they 
will clot over time.  If no such methods are employed, the cut will resist 
clotting in proportion to the caster's level.

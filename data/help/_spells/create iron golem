The power to invoke life in the lifeless is perhaps the most powerful gift
the loa can bestow.  Golems are powerful thralls created from simple materials
that will obey any simple command from their master.  Note that the power of
life is somewhat difficult to control, and any faltering on the part of the
would-be master may cause the golem to come into being enraged and berserk.

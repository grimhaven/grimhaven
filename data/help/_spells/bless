Receiving the blessings of a deity will grant a minor boost in ability to hit
and make a creature less susceptible to nonmagical bodily harm.  It also
increases the likelihood that a deity will intervene in the fate of the
recipient.  Duration of the blessing is typically less than 5 hours.

Blessed weapons will do increased damage to undead or lycanthropes.

Multiply invoking the bless prayer on people will increase the duration
it lasts.

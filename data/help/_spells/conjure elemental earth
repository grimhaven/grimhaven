Conjuring an elemental from their home plane of existence across the Sydarthae
and into The World is very difficult and not without risks.  Beyond the initial
expenditure of energy to bring the elemental across, the mage must continually
expend mental effort to subjugate the elemental to the mage's will.  It is
also possible that the elemental, once across, will be too powerful for the
mage to control; the effects of which may be deadly.

The maximum time the elemental will obey the mage is 12 hours but is dependent
on how the caster treats the elemental as well as the caster's leadership
capability.

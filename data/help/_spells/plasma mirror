Shortly before the ancient Arch-mage Solarrius tragic and mysterious demise,
he was working on what he called "shield of fire".  While he was never able
to successfully finish his research, nor could he have perfected it with
the limited magical apparatus of his day, his insights into this branch of
magic are still astounding.

With the discovery of Solarrius's tomb and his research notes in 765 P.S.,
modern day magicians have been able to refine his experimentations and the
plasma mirror spell is the result.

It is not fully understood to this day, but provides the mage a proactive
defense.  When physical damage is incurred, such damage is attenuated
slightly, and the amount of the attenuation is reflected back to whomever
applied the physical damage.

The plasma mirror spell is known to be of rather short duration.  The
plasma mirror spell can only be cast on the caster.

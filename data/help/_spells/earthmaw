The earthmaw spell is a devastating attack which causes the very 
earth to open and strike the player's enemy.  The spell will 
generally knock the victim down, but requires the player to be on
the surface of the ground to cast.

As with all players spells, casting in combat requires that the components
be held in one of the player's hands.

<h> tries hard to maintain a balance between being fun and making
you responsible for your actions/inactions.  In general, what that
translates as is that if something drastic happens that can be traced to
the code or the machine on which the game is run, we will happily fix the
problem to the best of our ability.  (Caveat:  This does not apply to
single items, pets, charmies, saddles, garrottes, equipment on mobs, items
dropped on ground, items in a mob, weapons stuck in a mob, keys, potions,
talens in a bag, lost in a crash even if our fault.)

However, the player is responsible for everything else, INCLUDING their
own machine, their link to the <h> game, and proper handling of their
character. 

Reimbursements come in two varieties, object reimbursement and experience
reimbursement.  The specifics of how these are handled are  detailed in those
help files.

Miscellaneous reimbursement : (pet renting)
A crash comes along and you notice that when you log in again, your pet gopher
is missing.  You paid 150 talens for fluffy, and his loss is kind of
depressing.  No reimb, sorry.  Pet renting is a frill that we aren't willing
(yet) to guarantee.  If a pet gets lost, we won't reimburse it.
 
Miscellaneous reimbursement : (abandoned pets)
Your pet gopher has become tired, and you order it to rest while you go
forth to adventure more.  For whatever reason, game crash, auto-logout, etc,
the next time you log in, fluffy is no longer with you.  Once again, no
reimbursement.  Pets are only saved if they are physically with you,
intentionally leaving them behind is an action you take at your own risk.

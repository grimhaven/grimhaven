Syntax:	idea

This will drop you into	a simple editor	similar	to the in-MUD mail system.

Type ~ and return on a blank line to send your idea, or ` on a blank line to       
cancel your idea submission.

Though all suggestions are welcomed, most suggestions do not receive responses
unless staff needs additional info.  To report a bug, use the BUG command.
Likewise, use TYPO to report a TYPO, and REQUEST for all other help requests.

Alternatively, you may visit http://www.sneezymud.com/Contact_Us.html and fill

Syntax: afk
Syntax: toggle afk

The afk command will cause you to go into afk mode. When in
this mode, you will send an AFK message to persons who attempt
to tell to you. 

Any command entered while in afk mode will bring you out of afk 
mode.

The afk toggle will allow the MUD to automatically set your AFK
status if you are idle.

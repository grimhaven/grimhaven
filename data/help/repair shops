Repair shops are located around The World and will gladly fix damage
that has occurred to your items for a price.  It does take awhile for
the blacksmith to complete the object, so you may want to have stuff
repaired while you are not playing.  Valid commands in the repair shop:

VALUE:	gets the cost and estimated time to complete repairs on the item
GIVE (item) (repairman): gives the item to the blacksmith who immediately
	starts to repair it.  He will give you a ticket that must be kept
	in order to pick the item up again.  Payment is due upon completion
	and the item will be given to whomever has the ticket and can afford
	to pay, so pay attention to where your tickets go.
GIVE TICKET (repairman): gives a ticket to the blacksmith.  Provided you
	can afford to pay the cost of the item that was repaired, he will
	return the item to you once repairs are complete.
GIVE ALL.DAMAGED : gives everything that has suffered damage to the repairman.
GIVE ALL.TICKET : gives all tickets to the repairman.

NOTE: Items left 15 days past their due date will be deleted.

Theology is the study and appreciation of different schools of
thought.  Students of theology can better control and focus 
beliefs to edify themselves.  Pondering the greater questions
of life expands the mind and allows for a greater understanding
of one's self.  Although much of what is learned is not of the
physical world the discipline may be learned in combination with,
or exclusive of, the more physically demanding skill of combat to
obtain a state of learning attractive to higher trainers.

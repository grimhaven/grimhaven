All shop types use the standard shop interface as described in HELP
SHOP OWNER.  Some shop types have special commands and slight
modifications to the standard interface.

# Repair man.
Notes:
Repair shops have 2 additional values for quality and speed.  These
affect the maximum repair quality and the speed of repairs,
respectively.  Less than 1 in either value decreases the cost of
repairs, greater than 1 increases the cost.

Repair shops currently make use of the expense ratio value, and should
always have this set to 1.

Special commands:
list -	Shows a list of all equipment currently under repair at this
	shop, along with the ticket number and cost of repairs.  This command
	is currently immortal only.



# Loan shark.
Notes:
The profit_buy value represents the defaulting penalty and the
profit_sell value is the base interest rate.  The setrates/loanrate
command is used to set the loan term length, the maximum talens loaned
per level (X) and the maximum loan at level 50 (Y) (the previous two values
define the loan curve based on level; the formula is
"(pow(ch->GetMaxLevel(), X) / pow(50, X) * Y)" ).

Special commands:
list loans - Shows a list of all current outstanding loans, with the
	loanee, amount owed, interest rate, when the loan is/was due and
	current amount owed.  This command requires the INFO privilege.
list repo - Shows a list of collection options for outstanding loans.
	This is currently unimplemented.

# Central Banker.
Notes:
The profit_buy value is the reserve deposit requirement for banks.
The profit_sell value is the rate of new money printed (which is distributed
soley via mobs at the moment).

Special commands:
list - Shows a list of all banks that are part of the central reserve system.

# Banker.
Notes:
The profit_sell value is the interest rate that the bank pays out.
The equity value reported by the info command is the cash on hand,
minus the value of all accounts.  A negative equity value means the
bank cannot cover all of its accounts (this is normal for a real life
bank), a positive value means that the bank has somehow made a profit.

Banks hold accounts both for players as well as corporations.  These
are listed together and for most purposes work transparently.
Corporate accounts withdraw/deposit at the corporate assistant.

Special commands:
list - Shows a list of all bank accounts held at this bank.

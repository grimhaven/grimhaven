Perception is the ability for one to notice things that most may overlook.

In terms of gaming, perception will govern how well a person will notice
secret doors in a room, traps on a pouch, and modify other skill bonuses.
It will also modify how far away one can perceive an object when scanning.
Those with low perception won't be very wary of anything and will be more
likely to miss important findings in their exploration.

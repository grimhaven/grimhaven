Here at SneezyMUD, we've made a lot of effort to try to provide newbies
with the most resources as possible to explain our historic game and get
new users up to speed with the many many commands and gameplay we offer.

Two basic and fun tutorials are the Visual New Users Guide, which is on
the web at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukslQWRMTU

And Aunt Dee.  Type "goto dee" to get directions to this interactive 
tutorial NPC who will send you on miniature quests, assign you tasks and
rewaard you with items and money.  She will walk you through the same
basic information as the visual new user's guide, but when you use Dee's
tutorial, you get to learn by doing.  Plus, you get a cookie!  Dee will
walk you through getting your armor on all the way to helping you kill 
your very first fuzzy mouse, and then set you free with some final tips.

She will continue to offer slightly more advanced information and can be
accessed anytime to get that into.  

Some people have reported that watching the visual new users guide AND
followingt the Aunt Dee tutorial together is beneficial; they each cover
the same ground, but with so many more avenues to absorn the information,
it seems it sticks faster.  Plus, as noted before, botht he video and the
NPC ("mob") tutorials are fun!

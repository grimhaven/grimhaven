Followers come in three varieties:

1.) Pets.  These are NPCs that have been purchased, or otherwise acquired,
to serve as their master's companion.  They will typically aid the master out
of simple loyalty, but may refuse orders that obviously put their own life
at risk.

2.) Charms.  An NPC that is under a magical compulsion to follow the orders
of the master that controls it.  Typically, the master of a charm must expend
mental energies to retain the charm as it is assumed that the NPC is an
unwilling follower seeking to break free.  A charm may resist some orders,
especially those that put the life of the charm in jeopardy.

3.) Thralls.  A thrall is an NPC that has no will of its own, and in most
circumstances, is a lifeform that the master created.  Golems, elementals
and zombies are obvious examples (although they may actually be charms if
the master has taken over someone else's thrall).  Thralls obey all orders
that they understand without question or reservation.

Followers may be given names via the rename command.

Followers may be given orders via the order command.

Followers will be preserved when you save (or rent), and will reload upon your
return to <h>.  Like equipment, followers will cost some money to rent.
Only followers that are in the same location as you are saved, so if you
leave a pet behind, it will NOT be saved.

Items that followers are carrying are ONLY saved when you rent out.  Items
carried by pets cost their normal rental cost to rent out on a pet.

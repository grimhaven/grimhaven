Syntax: toggle trophy

The trophy system records every mob kill that you make.  After killing
a particular mob a number of times, you will get less and less
experience with each kill.

The trophy command will list every mob you have killed, along with a
description of the amount of experience you would receive killing the
mob.  This amount is ONLY based on the number of times you have killed
that mob, it has no relation to the level of the mob or anything else.

Using consider on a mob will also show your trophy rating for that
mob.

The trophy toggle will report after each kill the relative amount of 
experience you can still attain from the mob.

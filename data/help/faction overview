Factions represent a political/religious organization dedicated to some cause
or bringing about some event.  Each faction has its own beliefs, hierarchy and
rules of conduct.  

At present, the following factions are officially recognized:
     Brotherhood of Galek
     Cult of Logrus
     Order of the Serpents

A person not belonging to any faction is considered Unaffiliated.  Any currently
affiliated member may leave their present faction by disbanding.  Any change
in affiliation will cause that person's faction percentage to drop.

It is not necessary to join any given faction.  While factions do receive
some benefits, there are also detriments involved in membership.  If you
choose not to join, remember to set your auto-join bit off.

The faction's current power is indicated by its potency.  Since to a large
degree, faction's influence rises and falls on the actions of its deities
(and the clerics they act through), it is important to keep the faction's
potency relative to others high.

Factions are also important in the attuning of holy symbols although
symbols can be attuned to unaffiliated clerics use.

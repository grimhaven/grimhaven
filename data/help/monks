Monks represent some of the many variations of martial artists.  In their
most basic form, monks train themselves to push physical and mental limits,
mastering the use and manipulation of internal energies.  As a result of
their training, they become living weapons capable of powerful strikes and
lightning quick attacks.  But, with great power comes great responsibility.
A monk will often face choices about how he or she will use their power.

All monks first learn the basics of meditation and breathing, important
building blocks for their journey toward enlightenment.  They then learn
some basic defensive techniques to prepare them for learning basic offensive
techniques (before learning to throw someone, you learn to fall).  These
techniques begin with strikes and kicks and ground work.  They also learn
to apply these techniques to withdraw from battle and also to fight multiple
opponents.

Once the young monk masters the basic movements, they being the journey
toward harnessing one's Chi, or internal energy.  This internal energy can
be used to promote healing, bolster one's natural defenses, sense and
and anticipate an opponent's movement (by detecting their center), and
to add power to one's strikes.

Monks also have a sash ranking system.  Every few levels a quest will be
offered to the monk, which must be completed in order to receive a sash.
Note that the quests can be very difficult and should be prepared for and
undertaken *very* carefully.

Monks have the following skill disciplines:
Monk Basic, Meditation and Internal Abilities, Focused Attacks,
Mind and Body Control, Balance and Leverage Skill

Before learning any advanced/specialized disciplines, a monk needs to
fully learn the monk and combat disciplines.

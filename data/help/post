Syntax: post <note> <message title>

Provided you have a note (upon which your message should exist)
and a place to put it (bulletin board) is in the room, you may post
the note.  Note that the note should have the relevant message already
on it before you post it.

Usually there will be a note and pen dispenser with an endless
supply of notes and pens that you can get. You can write your
note on these notes with the pen, and then post your note to the
board.

Syntax: alias <alias> <thing for alias to do>
        clear <alias #> will clear the alias for you.

Aliases allow you to carry out a complex command with few keystrokes.
The <h> alias system can hold up to 16 aliases and commands of
30 characters or less.

eg.:	alias cl cast cure light
	After setting this alias up, you could type:
	cl JoeBlow, and cure him instead of typing the whole spell out.

To view your present aliases, type ALIAS with no parameters.

Syntax: close <something>

Close pretty much does what it says, it closes something.
It is appropriate to use this on a wide variety of things: bags, chests,
doors, portals, gates, desks, wine skins, etc.

If the item is an object of some sort, you may use standard referencing
format to differentiate multiple, similar objects.
eg.
close 1.chest		close chest large
close 2.chest 		close chest small
close 3.chest 		close 2.chest small

If the item is an exit (door, gate, etc), and you close it, it will no longer
appear on the list of exits in a room until it is reopened.  Exits may be 
differentiated by doing:
close door north 	close door wooden 
close door east		close door steel
close door sw		close door large

Close will try and determine what you mean if you give it an ambiguous target.
That is, it will attempt to close the first <something> that is closeable and
not presently closed already that it can find.

Corporations exist to organize business, primarily shops.  Information
on corporations can be found in the GH Corporate Offices, which are
located in the Grimhaven Bank, in the north end of the lobby.  There
are also likely to be Corporate Offices available in other cities.

The primary purpose of corporations is to bundle shops together and
facilitate easy monitoring as well as automatic monetary transactions.

See the CORPORATE ENTITIES help file for some information on existing
corporations.

You may also wish to read the "shop owner" help file, which has a few
related commands, such as "dividend" and "reserve".

-list [[<logs> [<daily>]] <corp_id>]

no arguments.  You may pass an optional corporation id number to get
more detailed information.  If you are a corporate officer, you may
pass the keyword "logs" to see the corporate bank account logs.  You
may also pass the "daily" argument to see a simple daily log summary.

The administrators of <h> require that all characters follow certain
guidelines.  This is both to simplify administrative duties as well as to
assist the administrators in maintaining security.

1.) All accounts must have passwords.  This provides a basic level of
security and it is the responsibility of the account owner to keep others
from knowing the password.  Restitution of accounts/characters damaged
due to account hacking is handled on a case by case basis.

2.) All accounts need a valid email address.  The administrators do not verify
these addresses prior to granting access, however, the administrators reserve
the right to deny access to anyone that fails to provide a true address.

3.) No person should have more then one account.  Use of multiple accounts
will result in the elimination of all suspected accounts.

4.) Account sharing and character sharing is strictly prohibited.  All
characters within an account belong to that account.  Each account belongs
to one and only one person.  Use by any other person is regarded as
unauthorized and may result in sanctions.

5.) Hacking or attempting to hack an account is prohibited.  Attempting to
gain access to an account not owned by you is a violation of <h> rules
subject to sanctions.

6.) With regard to intent and fair play it is expected that a player will be
conscious of how their actions affect the mud.  Any action that is detrimental
to the mud can be considered a violation of the rules.  This would include
exploiting bugs, harassing players, or any other action that might be deemed
malicious or detrimental.

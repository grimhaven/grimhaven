Combat proficiency is a generic discipline covering the basics of using 
weapons effectively in combat as well as general tactics.  Full mastery
of the subject will prevent the student from injuring themselves or others
when in the thick of battle.  Lack of full training in these areas will result
in more screw-ups, worse chances to hit and a much lower overall damage in
combat.  Any serious adventurer who desires the ability to physically 
engage their enemies will learn this first.

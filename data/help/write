Syntax: write <note> <quill>

In order to write a note, you need a piece of blank paper (or similar), and
a pen of some sort. You can then type something like "write on the paper
with the pen", whereupon you will be asked to begin writing your note.

If you don't specify a quill or a note and a quill, then your
inventory will be search and the first ones found will be used.

Notes and quill are provided free of charge near most public bulletin
boards.  There is a public bulletin board directly above the inn in
Grimhaven, and there are more limited-access boards provided in the
larger, high-level cities.

To get in touch with a single person in a more private manner, use mail.

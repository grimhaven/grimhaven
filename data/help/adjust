related to their faction.

faction's members faction percentage for actions for or against <versus
faction>.  This <value> also affects the faction power and indirectly the
rate of piety regeneration for the faction's clerics.

The tithe <value> is adjusted similarly and affects how much money is
automatically collected from all faction members.

The properties of the caravans are set similarly.  Caravans are treated
in more depth in their own help file.

Syntax: disengage

Disengage is a way to stop fighting without fleeing.  It will stop you
from both hitting and from mere engaging status.  

Disengaging from full combat will give you a 1 round combat lag and stop
you from hitting.  Disengaging from "engaged combat" will lag you one
round and remove you from engaged combat. You can not disengage from a
fight totally if you are tanking.

average level - This score isn't really an average, it's based on the
combined level of all members, biased towards higher levels.  One
level 50 is worth more than two level 25's.

pounds of fish - This is based on the number of fishing records the
faction has as well as the total pounds of fish caught.  You have to
catch A LOT of fish to get very many points out of this.  Each record
translates to exactly 1 point though.

average trophy - Again, this isn't really an average.  It is based on
the trophy scores of each faction member, biased towards higher
levels.  A level 50 with 50% trophy is worth about the same as two
level 25's with 50% trophy each.

shops owned - This is based directly on the number of shops that
faction members have owner privileges at.  Each shop is only counted
once per faction.

faction wealth - This is based directly on the number of talens in the
faction bank account.

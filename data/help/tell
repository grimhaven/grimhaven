Syntax: tell <person> <message>

A generic way to communicate with other people in <h>.
Some rooms will prevent this command due to a magical dweomer of silence.

Tell will send a message strictly to the person referenced, regardless of
where they are in the mud.  It does require that you can actually "see"
the recipient.  ie, being blinded or in the dark will prevent.
   EX: tell joeblow meet me at center square

Using tell to flood a person's screen with spam is in poor taste.  Likewise,
using tell to be offensive or obnoxious will be dimly viewed by the game
maintainers and may lead to sanctions.

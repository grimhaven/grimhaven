Dexterity represents a character's hand-eye coordination.

In game terms, dexterity is your ability to land your blows.  It increases
your accuracy.  Also, above average dexterity will increase various combat
bonuses that are related to your ability to hit.  Dexterity plays a major
role in skills involving high hand-eye coordination such as thief skills.

Dexterity is also used to manipulate "volume".  Volume represents the space
an object occupies or its "bulk".  A feather that was 50' long might only
weigh a pound, but it would still require a good bit of skill to manipulate
and this is where dexterity comes into play.  ie. in order to manipulate
an object, you would need the strength to lift it, and the dexterity to
maneuver it.

Focus represents one's ability to concentrate on a task at hand.  For those
who use magic or divine intervention, focus will also help in generating
the necessary inner focus that these skills require.

In gaming terms, focus is a major factor in determining skill and spell
success.  One who has little focus will tend to fail tasks quite often.
However, one with above average focus will be more likely to succeed in a
skill, especially complex ones, due to their high concentration.

Focus works slightly different than other attributes.  Focus effects
sometimes use your chosen modifications without reference to your
racial ability to focus.

Shamans are practitioners of a few certain types of magic.  Mostly
loners, they have specialized in elements that provide a measure of
control over their environment. 

They have developed over time a relationship with the darker spirits and
are familiar with the governing laws of the undead.  They can extract magic
elixers from the earth and items they find around them to encapsulate the
magic of their flashier mage cousins.

Like porcupines, their self defense has used the power of their attackers 
to protect themselves.  Their relationship with the undead and the
darker arts has given them an understanding of the life force in each
being and has allowed shaman to develop ways to drain such life forces.
Not surprisingly, they also have developed the ability to restore some
life force although in a slow fashion using touch and communion.

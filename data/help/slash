Slash weapons are large edged weapons.  Swords, blades and axes are good
examples.  Any weapon that: SLASHES, CLEAVES, SLICES or CLAWS 
is a slash weapon.

Slash weapons are turned aside to one degree or another by very hard,
metallic armors, but tend to tear into leathers.  It is quite possible
that some creatures hide may be invulnerable or resistant to slash weapons
simply because their outer covering turns the blade away.

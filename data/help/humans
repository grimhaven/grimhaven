Mankind is the most prolific race on the face of The World.  In fact, humans
alone outnumber all of the other 5 civilized races combined.  This has meant
that civilization has grown along the lines dictated by mankind.  Dwellings,
roads, doors, clothing, utensils, etc are built with human specifications
in mind.

Human males range from 63 to 79 inches and 146 to 200 pounds.
Human females range from 61 to 72 inches and 104 to 140 lbs.
As equipment is designed for humans, they rarely have trouble finding
things that are a comfortable fit.

Humans are gifted with the ability to be good in all classes.  For this
reason, they have average values for all stats, being neither extremely
good nor bad at anything.

Humans have no special abilities.

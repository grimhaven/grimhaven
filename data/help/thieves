Thieves are highly agile creatures skilled at stealth and deviousness.
They typically want a high dexterity and high karma.  They have some
unique capabilities that few possess, such as picking locks and trap
knowledge.

While not combat-oriented, their study makes them the object of other's
hatred often enough that they have developed many underhanded abilities
disdained by true fighters.  Their skills center on thieving, looting
and murder.

Thieves chief drawback is that they are substantially weaker in a fight than
a true fighter.  Additionally, while they can use many types of armors, most are
too bulky and noisy to be of much benefit for their thieving skills.

Thieves have the following skill disciplines:
Adventuring, Murder, Looting, Thieving Skills, Pierce Specialization,
Slash Specialization
--------------------------
The thieving discipline is strictly for those of the thief class.  Thieves
are required to have 1.67% learning in this discipline for every level over
5th.

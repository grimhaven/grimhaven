Guilds are places of learning for the various classes.  Generally, they are
in places where you would expect them to be.  Mages like towers of sorcery,
clerics prefer cathedrals, etc.  Guilds are also the homes of guildmasters,
and it is these you must seek out to be taught the higher mysteries of a
particular class and to obtain the highest levels.  The more adept guildmasters
make themselves less accessible simply because otherwise, everyone would use
them.  You will have to explore The World to find them.  

Guildmasters are able to grant you additional levels, raise your stats and
grant practice sessions, although you will have to seek out the trainers to
actually learn the various skills in a discipline.

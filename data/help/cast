The cast command allows spell users to perform magic.
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

<spell> may be abbreviated, although realize the dangers of thinking that
something like dis was "dispel magic" when in reality it might be
"disintegrate".  Multiple word spells (dispel magic, magic darts, etc.) 
you can abbreviate both words.  eg. cast mag dar <target>

Not all spells require a <target>.  If no target is specified, <target> is
either the person you are fighting (offensive magic) or the person casting
the spell.

Unlike DIKUs, <h>'s spell system does not require the use of a ' to
surround the spells.  Clerical casters will use pray <spell> <target>
rather than "cast".  While casting or praying, the caster will have
reduced defensive capabilities and be more vulnerable to physical attacks.

Casting will generally take mana although it may also take other items
like vitality, components, and/or hit points.  Some utility spells maybe
renewed during the life of the spell.  Information about the ability to be renewed
of a specific spell is shown in attribute condition.

Each spell should have its own help file.  help <spell>

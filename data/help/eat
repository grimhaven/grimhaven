Syntax: eat <something>
Syntax: toggle eat

This command will allow you to attempt to eat an item should you be
hungry.  Not all races will be able to stomach or be satiated by the
same types of food.  

Once you are full, you cannot eat any more until
you are hungry again.  The "score" command will report your current
levels of hunger and thirst.

Food has a tendency to spoil after awhile.  It is often a good idea to
examine or taste your food before eating it to determine whether it is
safe to consume.  Food poisoning is an unpleasant experience.

You may choose to automatically eat and drink by turning the "eat"
toggle on.  Your character will not check for food or drink spoilage
when automatically eating or drinking.

Syntax: sneak <option>
Options: off, stop, retry

Sneaking allows a character to move more silently in the hopes of approaching
without being detected.  Sneaking requires a good bit of endurance both to
just attempt it, as well as to continue moving stealthily.  Obviously, the
chance of approaching undetected is affected by the amount of noise your
armor makes, although race and terrain also plays a role.

Sneaking makes a character harder to see, although not as much as if they 
were hiding.  Sleeping and resting will remove sneak.

To stop sneaking, just type "sneak off" or "sneak stop".  To re-attempt
sneak, type "sneak retry".  Sneaking is impossible while fighting or
mounted.

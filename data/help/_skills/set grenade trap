Successful completion of the trapping routine will create a grenade the looter
may use at any point in time at their discretion.  Grenades need to be held,
and thrown in a direction to be activated.  They automatically detonate a few
seconds later striking everyone in their immediate location.  Be warned that
grenades can be thrown back at the looter, or if the looter is careless, they
could walk into the room with the grenade and be hit by their own trap.
Grenades can only be thrown 1 room.  Grenades do a moderate amount of damage
to everyone in the room at the time of detonation.

Set traps allows a skillful looter from dissuading an overeager pursuer from
following or to protect the looter's booty.  Traps come in 4 varieties, 
exit traps, container traps and land mines and grenades.

All traps take time to set.  Improper training may cause the trap to backfire
on the looter during the trapping process.  The damage the trap will do depends
on the trapper's level, the trapper's skill, the variety of trap, and the trap
type.  <trap type>'s are located in a separate help file.

Note: "damage" as used below is a generic term.  For trap types that don't do
physical harm (sleep, poison, etc), greater "damage" reflects an increased
chance to be affected by the trap.  eg.  A higher immunity to poison would be
needed to dodge the effects of a "high damage" poison trap.  Obviously,
everyone that doesn't save, will be affected by the sleep, poison, etc.
equally.

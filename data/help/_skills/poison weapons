Syntax: poison <weapon> [poison]

Exceptionally devious thieves will poison their weapons so that they do
extra damage from the insidious toxin.  Only slash or pierce style weapons
may be poisoned, and a quantity of poison must be in the thief's inventory
in order to be successful.  The poison on the blade will fairly quickly
evaporate, so it is best to wait until just before an attack to apply the
poison.  The poison will be added to the victim the first time the blade
hits.

Since the poison used is such that it can be ingested through the skin, it
is especially dangerous and many a thief has become poisoned while trying
to apply it to their blade.

Weapons that have been blessed by the deities may not be poisoned.  Also,
strong intrinsic magic prevents poisons from working effectively.

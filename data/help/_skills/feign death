Feign death allows a monk to cause others to believe he has died.  The
heart rate is slowed to near zero and other bodily functions are shutdown.
The monk will then enter a sleep-like trance, and it is hoped that the
monk's enemies will cease fighting and lose interest, allowing the
monk to make an escape.

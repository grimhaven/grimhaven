The climb skill assists in a character's ability to scale difficult vertical
surfaces.  While almost any character has the potential to climb successfully,
the climb skill will dramatically improve your chances.  Other criteria when
climbing include whether things are held in the character's hands, the quality
of the character's arms and legs and the climber's dexterity.  A failed
climb typically causes the character to plummet earth-ward.

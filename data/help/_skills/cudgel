Syntax: cudgel <victim>

Cudgel is an attack whereby the murderer smacks the victim on the side of the
head in an attempt to knock the victim unconscious.  It requires a small, blunt
weapon be used.  A high learning in cudgel allows a thief to utilize weapons in
their offhand for this attack.  Obviously, cudgeling an opponant of great size
difference or to a creature that can't possibly notice will be ineffective as
well.  Some creatures are more aware than others.

Helmets are an effective foil to cudgel attacks.

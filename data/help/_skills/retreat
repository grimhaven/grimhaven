The retreat skill is utilized during a flee from combat to maintain a fighting
withdrawal while escaping.  A successful retreat will not invoke panic in the
person fleeing, give greater control over which direction they are able to
escape in and minimize the losses (xp, etc) that may occur due to fleeing.
Retreating is handled automatically anytime you flee.

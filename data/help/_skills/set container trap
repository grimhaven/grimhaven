Syntax: trap container <item> <trap type>

Container traps may be placed on chests, bags or other containers.  They
require a higher skill to do properly due to the higher degree of jostling
a container is expected to take when being moved about.  Container traps
trigger whenever someone opens the container.  Container traps do a moderate
to high degree of damage to the person opening the trap.

Set traps allows a skillful looter from dissuading an overeager pursuer from
following or to protect the looter's booty.  Traps come in 4 varieties, 
exit traps, container traps, land mines and grenades.

All traps take time to set.  Improper training may cause the trap to backfire
on the looter during the trapping process.  The damage the trap will do depends
on the trapper's level, the trapper's skill, the variety of trap, and the trap
type.  <trap type>'s are located in a separate help file.

Note: "damage" as used below is a generic term.  For trap types that don't do
physical harm (sleep, poison, etc), greater "damage" reflects an increased
chance to be affected by the trap.  e.g.  A higher immunity to poison would be
needed to dodge the effects of a "high damage" poison trap.  Obviously,
everyone that doesn't save, will be affected by the sleep, poison, etc. 
equally.

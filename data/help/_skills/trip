Syntax: trip <victim>

The trip skill lets the warrior attempt to trip an opponent to the ground.
Triping is a physical attack, and requires the warrior to be able to
successfully hit the victim.  The closer you are to your target the easier it
is to trip them so that person most directly fighting will have the best chance
of success.  Balance is key for the trip skill and improper use may cause the
warrior to fall over.

Shoulder throw allows the jumandoist to heave an opponent off its feet and
toss it onto the ground where it is more vulnerable.

Shoulder throwing is a physical attack, and as such, requires the Jumandoist 
be able to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the
attempt to fail.

You must be of roughly the same stature as your victim to successfully
shoulder throw them.

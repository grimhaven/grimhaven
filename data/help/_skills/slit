Syntax: slit <victim>

Throat slitting is an exceptionally powerful attack used by a masterful thief
to attempt deadly murder upon a victim.

The thief is required to move in stealthfully behind his/her victim and is
required to use a small weapon as is done with backstabbing. A thief's chance
at success depends on the victims height as well as the amount of noise the
thief makes.

If <creature> is not specified, you will attempt to slice the throat of any 
creature in your room with which a groupmate is fighting.

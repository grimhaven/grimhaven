Syntax: trap mine <trap type>
Syntax to activate: Syntax: drop <mine>

Mine traps are the most difficult to set.  Successful completion will create
a land mine that can be placed in any location of the looter's choosing.
Land mines trigger whenever someone moves out of the room with the land mine.
The trapper, and those grouped with the trapper are of course immune to
triggering the land mine (note: the immunity is to triggering it, not to the
effects if someone else triggers it).  Land mines are not 100% reliable, often
people will walk through regions with them without triggering them simply by
not stepping on them due to blind luck.  Damage on a mine trap is quite high,
often killing the target outright.  Additionally, some mines spray their
effects throughout the room.

Set traps allows a skillful looter from dissuading an overeager pursuer from
following or to protect the looter's booty.  Traps come in 4 varieties, 
exit traps, container traps and land mines and grenades.

All traps take time to set.  Improper training may cause the trap to backfire
on the looter during the trapping process.  The damage the trap will do depends
on the trapper's level, the trapper's skill, the variety of trap, and the trap
type.  <trap type>'s are located in a separate help file.

Note: "damage" as used below is a generic term.  For trap types that don't do
physical harm (sleep, poison, etc), greater "damage" reflects an increased
chance to be affected by the trap.  eg.  A higher immunity to poison would be
needed to dodge the effects of a "high damage" poison trap.  Obviously,
everyone that doesn't save, will be affected by the sleep, poison, etc.
equally.

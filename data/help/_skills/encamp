Syntax : camp

The encamp skill allows one to establish a refuge in most outdoors areas.  Some 
conditions may prevent you from setting up a camp in what would otherwise be a 
perfectly natural spot.

All members of the camper's group will benefit from increased regeneration of 
hit points and moves while encamped.  Degree of regeneration is based upon skill
proficiency.

Additionally, camps may be used as places to exit the game using the <c>rent<1> command.

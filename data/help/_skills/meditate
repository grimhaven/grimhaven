Meditation permits the spell caster to regain mana at an increased rate by
focusing the mind on mental revitalization.  Anything that disturbs the
meditation, such as conversations or loud noises, will cause the meditation to
cease.  The amount of mana regained and the degree to which meditation will 
help is proportional to the spell caster's training in meditation.

Hunger thirst and drunkenness will prevent meditation.

Meditation does not replenish powerstones.

Grapple is a wrestling skill that causes the grappler to knock the victim
off its feet and hold it immobile for a number of rounds.  The grappler
tends to lose attacks since he will have his hands full holding the
opponent. Sometimes if very successful, he will tie the opponent up
totally. Grappled opponents will sometimes switch to attacking the
grappler rather than the being they were fighting originally. It is
notoriously difficult to grapple a monk. 

Grappling is a physical attack, and as such, requires the grappler be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

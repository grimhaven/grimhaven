Quivering palm is a fabled monk attack using knowledge of anatomy to
cause instant death with but a touch.  The palm is used to cause a
fatal vibration to literally shatter a creatures vital organs from the
inside.  It is only possible to utilize this on humanoid creatures,
and the attempt will fail if the creature is radically more powerful
than the monk.  It requires a high expenditure in mental powers, and
long recuperations (3-4 days) are required between attempts.  The attempt
will almost certainly kill the victim outright, or have no effect at all.

Quivering palm is a physical attack, and as such, requires the monk be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

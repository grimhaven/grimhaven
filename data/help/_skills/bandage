Syntax: bandage <person> <location>

Bandaging will allow you to cover <person>'s body <location> with a bandage.
The <location> may not have any equipment on it, and the person doing the
bandaging must possess enough bandages to cover the <location>.  (ie,
a finger requires fewer bandages then the body itself).

Bandaged limbs will cease bleeding and will regenerate more health.
Bandages once removed are useless.

Any <location> may be bandaged at any time.  You should be as specific about
<location> as possible (ie, use finger-left, wrist-right syntax).

Note that bandaging animals has tricky syntax.  Some examples: "bandage bear
foot-right", "bandage bear foot-back-left", "bandage horse leg-back-right"

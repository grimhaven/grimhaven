Doorbash is a brute strength method of opening a sealed exit.  Success
is dependent on the strength of the doorbasher versus the weight of the
door and the degree of security the lock affords versus the doorbasher's
skill level.  A successful doorbash will generally destroy the door,
causing the doorbasher to stumble into the next room.  Opening the
door in this manner will activate any traps that may be set on the door.
Doorbashing not only requires a small expenditure of exertion, but is
mildly damaging to the doorbasher.

Doorbash will fail automatically if done on portcullises or drawbridges.
Caved in exits can not be doorbashed nor are magical wards susceptible to
being defeated by doorbashing.

Doorbash will also stun you for a brief period of time.

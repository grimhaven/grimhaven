Syntax: spy

When looking at characters, the thief will be able to look at the inventory
that creature is carrying.  An evaluation of the creature's wealth will also be
reported.  Accuracy of the report is based on the learning in spy.  In
addition, the character looked at will not notice that they are being scoped
out.

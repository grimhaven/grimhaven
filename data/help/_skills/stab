Stab allows the murderer to thrust a dagger into the victim.  This stab is
above and beyond the normal number attacks.  The payoff for a successful
stab though is an immensely powerful attack designed to plunge the weapon
into the victim and then twist it in the wound.  The attack form typically
causes the thief to over-extend their attack and it may take a round or two
for the murderer to recover from this attack.

Stabbing is slightly tiring.

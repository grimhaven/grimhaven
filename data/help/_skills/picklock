Picking locks is one of the staples in a thief's bag of tricks.  It requires a 
lockpick be held in the primary hand to attempt.  Successfully picking a lock
is dependent on the difficulty of the lock and the skill of the thief.  Not
all locks can be picked, but the longer a thief spends on a given lock, the
better their chance of getting it to open.  Note that the lock pick will
eventually snap, or the lock jam, but it is usually worthwhile to keep after
a lock once started.

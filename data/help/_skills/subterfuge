Syntax: subterfuge <creature>

Subterfuge will permit the thief to attempt to befuddle <creature> in the hopes
that it will forget about who it was hunting and/or hating.  The attempt will
require a good bit of vitality.  Success is dependent on the thief's 
intelligence, wisdom and karma.  Subterfuge becomes very difficult on 
creatures of higher level than the thief.  A failed attempt may lead to 
the thief being attacked.

Note that subterfuge is really only useful when the <creature> hates someone
other than the thief.

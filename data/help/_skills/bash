Syntax: bash <victim>

Bash is an attempt to knock an opponent off their feet so that they may be
attacked more easily.  It requires the basher to be holding a shield in their
primary or secondary hand unless they are unusually skilled.  One way to obtain
that specialization of the skill is to train as a warrior in the brawling
discipline.

Bash does not work well in water or against mounted victims.  Bashing creatures
of short stature is difficult, while creatures of tall stature are generally
too hard to knock over.  It is notoriously difficult to bash a monk.  Success
at bashing is also dependent on relative weights and dexterities. 

Bashing is a physical attack, and as such, requires the basher be able to
successfully hit the victim.  The closer you are to your target the easier it
is to bash so that person most directly fighting will have the best chance of
success.  Failure to bash successfully may cause the basher to fall.

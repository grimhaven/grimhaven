Syntax: smooth <item>

The smooth skill permits the user to repair the quality of <item> for
blunt-type <item>s

The <item> must be a weapon and it must be held in the primary hand.  
Additionally, a file of some sort must be in your inventory.  The
file will slowly be used up with the amount being determined by how 
much "smoothing" must be done.  Lastly, smoothing will require a decent 
amount of time to complete, the amount is proportional to how much smoothing
must be done.

Smoothing pierce or slash weapons is not permitted.

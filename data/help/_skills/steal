Syntax: steal <object> <victim>

Acquiring goods that belong to others but have not been defended or protected
adequately, is what a looter is best known for.  This skill teaches the ways to
go about subverting the defenses that stand in the looter's way.  Success at a
steal is dependent on the looter's ability and nimbleness, the defender's
awareness and the difficulty of taking the item.  Obviously, the easiest thefts
would be by a highly skilled and dextrous looter on an unaware and/or drunk
victim for a small and easily accessible item.  It is typically easiest to
steal a creature's money, followed by items in their inventory, with the
hardest theft being of something worn on the target's person.

Horbilation permits the skilled Yofuist to ignore or reduce the effects
of physical suffering and otherwise resist pain.  The amount of resistance
depends on the horbilist's training, but may reduce damage by as much as 25%.

Horbilation expends vast amounts of mental concentration and physical vitality
to accomplish and continues until either all mental or physical energy is
expended.  Failure to properly focus at the beginning of the horbilation
will still cause the expenditure of these energies, but does not provide the
physical protection that a successful horbilation achieves.

Syntax: conceal {target}
Syntax: conceal stop {target}

Conceal is the attempt to eliminate your trail and prevent others from
tracking you.  Success is based on the player's training as well as the
tracking ability of the hunter.

At high learnedness, the player may attempt to conceal other people's
trails for them.

The "stop" argument allows you to stop concealment.

Dodge is the ability to anticipate your opponent's move in order to
avoid being hit.  Everyone dodges to some extent, but thieves have
taken this to a different level.  The best defense is to not be there.

Under development but it does have some effects.

Change:  4.1 dodge was reserved for Monks.  That ability differs from
this concept of dodge and has been moved to a more advanced form of
defense known as Jirin.

Through the powers of Snofalte, a person may cause bleeding to slow to a
trickle until such time as real medical attention can be sought.  This ability
both lessens the damage of bleeding as well as limits the amount of actual 
blood-loss.

Snofalte is automatically attempted whenever the practitioner is bleeding.

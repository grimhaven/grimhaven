Syntax: dissect <corpse>
Syntax: toggle dissect

Dissection permits the adventurer to extract useful body parts from dead
creatures.  Whether a given corpse has anything useful is dictated by what
creature the corpse came from originally.  Useful items may include food,
spell components and other items used for magical purposes.

Dissection can only be done once per corpse.

Toggling dissect on will cause you to automatically attempt to dissect all
corpses of mobs you slay.  It will also inform you of any usable hide you
may be able to skin from the corpse.

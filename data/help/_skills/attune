Syntax: attune <item>

The attune skill permits attuning of a symbol to the attuners faction.
The symbol will be unusable before attuning and usable only by
faction members after the attuning process is complete.

The item must be a symbol and it must be held in the primary hand.
Additionally, the attuner must have some holy water in inventory
sufficient for the task.

This water will be used up in the attuning proportional to the value of
the symbol.  Lastly, attuning will require a decent amount of time to
complete, the amount is variable and depends on skill and value of
the symbol.

Alternatively, a cleric or deikhan can get symbols attuned from attuners
in The World.  This will be cheaper and faster usually but the skill can
be used by players in the wild.

Syntax: search {direction}

Search permits a thief to search the area for signs of traps or concealed
exits.  The search is somewhat exhausting regardless of whether a trap or
door is found.  Success at detecting an exit is dependent on the ability
of the thief.

Search with no parameter will cause you to look in all directions.

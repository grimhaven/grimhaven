Syntax: springleap <victim>

Spring leap is an interesting counter move taught to monks as a response to
being knocked off their feet.  The move will allow the monk to leap back to
their feet, and at the same time kick the enemy.  It can be done either
automatically as a response to some attacks or manually by the monk under the
right conditions.

Spring leap is a physical attack, and as such, requires the Jumandoist be able
to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to
fail.

Disarming an opponent causes any weapon the opponent is using to be
dislodged and tumble free.  This typically makes the opponent easier
to defeat.  Success depends on your training in the disarm skill, and
obviously superior foes are able to counter most disarming moves you
can make.

Disarm is a physical attack, and as such, requires the warrior be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

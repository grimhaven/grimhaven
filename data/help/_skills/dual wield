Dual wield gives the ranger a greater ability in wielding weapons in their
"off"  hand.  A higher degree of learning in dual wield will give the
ranger a greater chance to hit with their offhand weapon and lower any
weight penalties on the offhand weapon. 

This skill, in order to be first obtained, will require a quest.  The
quest will be started by the trainer of this skill at the appropriate
time.  Until this quest is completed, one will not be able to either
perform or practice it.

Note: any character class on <h> is capable of wielding 2 weapons. 
However, under normal conditions, this off-hand weapon suffers certain
penalties (lower tohit, fewer attacks, less damage etc).  Dual wield
lessens the effects of these penalties.

Swim permits you to move through regions of water.  Not everyone is capable of
swimming, most notably, dwarves have an aversion to water.  The chance of 
successfully swimming is based predominantly on your swimming ability, but is
also modified for factors such as water condition (rough vs calm sea), 
currents, how much weight you are trying to drag around, and whether your limbs
are functioning and free to move.  Failed swims can cause drowning to occur.

Swimming is done automatically anytime a character attempts to move through
water.  You do NOT need to type "swim east" or whatever.

Note that it is possible to walk out into deep water, but swimming is
required if you want to move back to land.  Watch where you are going if you
can't swim.

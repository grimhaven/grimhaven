The counter move skill works automatically in response to hand to hand combat.
Any attempt to initiate various brawling skills against the monk will have a
chance of being countered.  The chance of successfully countering the move
depends on the learnedness of the monk at countering and the skill of the
person attempting the hand-to-hand combat.  If successfully countered, the move
will either fail outright or be turned so that it backfires on the brawler.

Penance is how a cleric shows remorse for the sins that have been committed 
against the teachings of the cleric's deities.  While showing penance, deities
typically reward the cleric with increased piety regeneration.  If your
deities are under-powered, showing penance may be the only way to achieve
any regeneration of piety at all.

Clerics can not properly concentrate on their penance if they are drunk,
hungry or thirsty.

The amount of piety regenerated depends on how long the cleric has been
showing penance continually, as well as the relative power of that cleric's
deities.

Syntax: sharpen <item>

The sharpen skill permits the user to repair the quality of <item>.  "Sharpen"
in this sense is a generic term, and means that slash style weapons are
sharpened or pierce style are made more pointy.

The <item> must be a weapon and it must be held in the primary hand.  
Additionally, a whetstone of some sort must be in your inventory.  The
whetstone will slowly be used up with the amount being determined by how 
much "sharpening" must be done.  Lastly, sharpening will require a decent 
amount of time to complete, the amount is proportional to how much sharpening 
must be done.

Sharpening blunt weapons is not permitted.

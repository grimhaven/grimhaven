Syntax: repair <item>

Monks lead a simple life, at many times alone and far from others.  Thus, it
has become necessary for them to learn the skills needed to repair their own
equipment.  As such, all monks are taught sometime during their training to
learn to mend their armor, which often consists of leathers, living materials,
and hides.

The appropriate tools must be held and in the room and the item you wish to
repair must be in your inventory in order to repair it.

Syntax: repair <item>

Deikhans are closely attuned with the astral nature of the
spiritual realm, and at some point during their training they
are taught how to repair objects made of materials from this
realm.  They can also use this ability to fix food.

The appropriate tools must be held and in the room and the item
you wish to repair must be in your inventory in order to repair
it.


Deikhans are skilled at mending materials of a spiritual nature
and materials made of food.:

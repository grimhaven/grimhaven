Berserk is actually an advanced combat attack state (of which the other ones
are defensive, normal, offensive - see HELP ATTACK).  Berserk mode is
like super-offensive in which the berserker disregards personal danger in
order to attack.  Berserkers will attack anything and everything within
easy reach, except obvious friends.  Anything that wanders in while a
berserker is still enraged will find itself fighting before too long.

Berserkers are fairly easy to hit as they make few defensive moves, although
the more skilled at berserking someone is, they are able to manage some
defense.  On the other hand, a berserker's fury grants them an additional
attack per combat round (extra 50% chance of swing from each hand), so
beware their wrath.  The berserker will also have more capacity to withstand
damage since in their rage they don't feel it.

A berserker is incapable of fleeing from combat.  Once berserking has begun,
it wears off a few moments after combat has stopped and there is nothing
left to kill.

Berserking characters will receive the same benefits (in terms of tohit
bonuses) as a person in offensive attack mode.

Failed berserk attempts prevent further attempts to berserk for 5 mud hours.

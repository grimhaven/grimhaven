Syntax: backstab <victim>

Backstab is an exceptionally powerful attack whereby a small, pierce-style
weapon is thrust violently into the victim's back.

Only certain weapons may be used to backstab with (small and pointy) and in
addition, the attacker MUST be moving silently enough to be undetected.  A
victim in a fight is slightly easier to hit.  A thief must be sneaking to
successfully backstab and a thief's chances to hit a backstab will dramatically
improve if the thief is silent.

Backstabbing is a physical attack, and as such, requires the murderer be able
to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to
fail.

If <victim> is not specified, you will attempt to backstab any creature in your
room with which a groupmate is fighting.

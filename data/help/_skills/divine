Syntax: divine <drink container>

Divination allows the ranger to seek out underground water sources in the
ranger's immediate location.  Success depends on the ranger's training while
quantity of the water source depends on the local terrain and the ranger's level.

Any water located will be put into <drink container> which must be held by or in
the inventory of the ranger.

Divining can only be done once every 12 hours.

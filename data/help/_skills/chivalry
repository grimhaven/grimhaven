The various deikhan orders have long maintained a strong command of mounted
combat, testing and perfecting new techniques and training their disciples in
the most successful tactics.  This gives Deikhans an unparalleled advantage
when fighting from atop a mount.  Chivalry represents the Deikhans command over
these techniques. 

Chivalry grants the mounted deikhan greater offensive and defensive
capabilities.  These translate into successfully hitting more frequently, and
being hit much less often.  It should be noted that some of the limitations of
mounted combat, specifically fewer overall swings, still come into play, but
the effects of chivalry more than make up for them.

The effects of this skill are handled automatically.

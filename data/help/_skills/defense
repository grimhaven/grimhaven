This skill is slowly learned over time.  Level, AC, and Defense skill are the
primary base factors in your ability to evade hits in combat.  Defense skill
has no bearing on how hard you get hit just on how well you overcome your
opponents offense.  Other factors that affect your ability to evade swings are
attack mode, certain spells, your ability to see, your agility, and your
position.

Your defensive skill does not directly add to your defense but affects your
ability to use your armor.  For example, if you wear a piece of body armor with
X AC.  You will get 1/2 X by wearing the armor.  How much of the other 1/2 X
you receive as a benefit depends on your defense ability.  Players that tank
often will get more benefit from their equipment.  However, be aware that mage
and cleric spells that provide protection do not rely on your defensive skill
but directly add to your ability to evade hits. 

Note that the defense is a long term skill and as such will most likely be
continually learned throughout your characters career.  Do not be alarmed if it
seems to be going up very slowly.

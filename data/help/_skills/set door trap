Syntax: trap exit <direction> <trap type>

Exit traps may be placed on doors, gates, or other barriers along the direction
of travel.  They are easy to set (and relatively easy to detect).  Exit traps
are triggered when the exit is opened.  Exit traps do a moderate amount of
damage to the victim opening them, and may also lightly harm others in the
vicinity.

Set traps allows a skillful looter from dissuading an overeager pursuer from
following or to protect the looter's booty.  Traps come in 4 varieties, 
exit traps, container traps and land mines and grenades.

All traps take time to set.  Improper training may cause the trap to backfire
on the looter during the trapping process.  The damage the trap will do depends
on the trapper's level, the trapper's skill, the variety of trap, and the trap
type.  <trap type>'s are located in a separate help file.

Note: "damage" as used below is a generic term.  For trap types that don't do
physical harm (sleep, poison, etc), greater "damage" reflects an increased
chance to be affected by the trap.  eg.  A higher immunity to poison would be
needed to dodge the effects of a "high damage" poison trap.  Obviously,
everyone that doesn't save, will be affected by the sleep, poison, etc.
equally.

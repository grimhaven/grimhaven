Stomp is an underhanded fighting technique in which the attacker attempts to
crush the opponent with his or her foot.  Against very small foes, it can
be quite lethal as the stomp literally squishes the opponent.  Against
taller foes, it is mostly limited to crushing the toes of the opponent.

Stomping is a physical attack, and as such, requires the stomper be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

To fish, you need a rod or pole and some bait.  When have both in your
possession, hold the rod and use the "fish" command to fish.  You can
also specify a direction, to fish on land or off a bridge.  Ex: fish down

There is a fishing store south of Grimhaven, on the path towards the jungle,
near the first bridge.

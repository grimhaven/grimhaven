Syntax: hurl <victim> <direction>

Hurl is the act of using leverage to physically hurl someone out of the room.
It is essentially a combination of shoulder throw and shove.

Hurl is a physical attack, and as such, requires the monk be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

You must be of roughly the same stature as your victim to successfully hurl
them.

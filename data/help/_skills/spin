Syntax: spin <victim>

Spin is an attempt to grab hold an opponants arm and spin them into confusion.
A successful skill roll is required for success, as well as passing a dexterity
check.  Success will daze your opponant enough that he/she/it will fall to the
ground lightheaded.

The spin skill requires that your hands are free unless a high degree of
brawling specialization is known.

Spinning is a physical attack, and as such, requires the warrior to be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempted spin to
fail.

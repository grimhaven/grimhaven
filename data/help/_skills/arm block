Arm block is a basic defensive skill related to the Karoki Discipline.
In conjunction with Jirin and Leg Block, this skill involves not only
dodging, but also blocking.

Arm block will have some specific effects with respect to unarmed combat,
but in general combat terms, it will provide some damage absorbing
capability.  In conjunction with Shogoki, wearing armor bracers, this
should provide a considerable amount defense, maybe equal that to a
shield.

How this is applied to combat has yet to be coded or even fully
conceptualized.

Note:  Almost all monk disciplines begin with some form of defense versus
that particular type of attack.  One of the things I'm trying to achieve
is a balance where two equally trained monks may neutralize each other
special abilities.

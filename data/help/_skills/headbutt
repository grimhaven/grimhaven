Headbutt is a gutsy combat move in which the attacker lunges forward and 
thrusts his or her head quickly into the opponent.  Headbutting is slightly
damaging to the attacker, although good head armor can absorb most of the
damaging effects.  Success at headbutt is agility dependent and also reflective
of the attacker's normal chances to hit the opponent.  

Note that the headbutt will hit the victim in the body location that is at 
the same height as the attacker's forehead.  This means that short attackers
will headbutt victim's shins.  Also, it is impossible to headbutt victims
that are remarkedly shorter than the attacker as bending over would put
the attacker at too much of a disadvantage in terms of being off-balance.

Headbutting is a physical attack, and as such, requires the headbutter be
able to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt
to fail.

Advanced kicking is the skill of taking kick to its highest form.
Once this skill is gained, you no longer execute a single powerful
kick every few rounds, but instead are able to snap off kicks each
round.  Experience practitioners may be able to get off as many as 3
kicks per round.  Of course these kicks do somewhat less damage, but
the sheer volume more than makes up for the decrease.

Wizardry permits mages and other spell casters greater control of their
magic that they may use less physical and mental control.  Such control
permits them to cast spells with the components in less important places.
eg, no training requires components in the primary hand, increased
training permits that component to gradually move to the second hand and
then slowly to the spell bag.  Such training has also been known to yield
a higher control over complicated spells.  This allows the mage to
manipulate the spell in such a way that it does maximal effect and gives
the prospective victim a lower chance to dodge.  The Wizardry discipline
increases as a mage or shaman gains levels and power.

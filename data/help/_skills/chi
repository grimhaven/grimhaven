Syntax: chi all
Syntax: chi <person>
Syntax: chi <object>

A monk may project his life force in a variety of ways to produce a
number of different effects.  The exact effects possible depend primarily
on the monk's skill in using chi and the Meditation and Internal Abilities
discipline.

Chi <person> attacks that <person> with a mental blast of energy.

Chi all is a more advanced form of "chi <person>" effectively attacking
everyone in the room not in your group with a lower damage mental blast.

Chi, on yourself, will protect you from other chi attacks, and also protects
slightly from frost and cold.

Chi, on an object, will have an effect that is dependant on the object type.
For example, it can light, and extinguish lights.  It may have other effects
too, depending on the object type.

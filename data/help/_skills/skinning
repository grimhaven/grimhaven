Skinning allows a ranger to skin a creature that has been slain and
obtain its hide.  Hides have a reasonable value in the herbal and
organic markets of The World.

The time it takes to skin a creature is dependent on its size.

Skinning only works on appropriate creatures.

Once you begin to skin a creature, you can STOP at any time.  Also a
corpse can be left half skinned then returned to later, as long as it
is still around.

Skinning can be dangerous, failure can both dull a weapon and hurt the
person performing the task.

If you have auto-dissect on, it will tell you if a corpse is able to be
skinned or not.   See HELP TOGGLE for more information on this.

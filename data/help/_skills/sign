Syntax: sign <message>

Signing allows communication between two characters without the use of words.
In order for a message to be successfully passed, the signer must known sign in
order to form an intelligible message and those that see it must know sign in 
order to understand it.

Unlike many skills, almost everyone is able to sign.  Of course, not knowing
the skill means your message is pretty much gibberish to everyone else.

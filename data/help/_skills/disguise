Syntax: disguise <creature>

Disguise permits the thief to alter their appearance so as to appear
as if they were a <creature>.  Since disguising yourself as something
out of the ordinary would induce stares, there are only certain
<creature>s endorsed by the thieves guild as legitimate disguises.
Most of these disguises are known only to the thieves that train
others in the ways of the skill but even more have been left to
discover.  The ability to disguise depends greatly on one's level and
learning in the discipling and skills themselves.  Unfortunately the
act is greatly taxing on the thief so time must be spent between
attempts.

Doing disguise with no arguments will tell you what general disguises
you can use.

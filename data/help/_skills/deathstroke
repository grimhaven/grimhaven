Deathstroke is a single, very destructive, fighting move designed to
hit the victim in the most vulnerable vital organ.  Success depends
on nimbleness of the attacker versus the victim as well as how well
defended the victim is to begin with.  It requires a lot of energy to
make the move.  A missed deathstroke allows the victim a free deathstroke
at you in return.  There is also a chance of the opponent switching to you
or you to your opponent on a successful deathstroke.

Deathstroke is a physical attack, and as such, requires the warrior be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

Kick is an attempt to plant your foot on the opponent and damage them.
The kicks can hit various locations (head, chest, crotch, shin) with
the location being determined by the kicker's flexibility as well as
the height difference between the kicker and the victim.  Damage from
a kick is dependent on the level of the kicker, although depending on
where the kick lands, additional damage or affects may accrue.  Kicking
is slightly exhausting.

Kicking is a physical attack, and as such, requires the kicker be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

Most non casting classes can kick to varying degrees of success.

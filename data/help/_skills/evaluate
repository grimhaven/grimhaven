Syntax: evaluate <item>
Syntax: evaluate room

Evaluate will yield extended information about <item>.  Accuracy and type of
information yielded is related to how well learned the evaluator is.  There is
a degree of randomness built into each evaluation, so do not be surprised to
see the information change with each evaluation.

Evaluation works on armor, clothing, weapons, bows, arrows, components,
staves, traps, wands, potions, scrolls, and symbols.

Not all classes are able to evaluate all items and some classes will evaluate
certain items better than others (at the same degree of learnedness in the
skill). 

NOTE ON MAGIC ITEM EVALUATION:
Evaluation of magic items (wands, staves, potions, scrolls and components)
require knowledge about the identify spell.  You aren't required to actually
cast identify on the item, although your learnedness in this spell will
factor into your knowledge when evaluating.

NOTE ON ARMOR EVALUATION:
Evaluate uses an absolute yardstick; trying to compare objects of different
types (eg. helm vs shield) in terms of armor or structure has little practical
use as the two body slots (head and hold) are on separate relative scales.

In shops, it is possible to evaluate items for sale.  This is done by doing
evaluate <item> or evaluate <item #>.

NOTE ON ROOM EVALUATION:
This will give you quick information about the room you are in and will allow
rangers to know if they're in a nature area.

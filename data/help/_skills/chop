Chop is a single, devastating blow with the hand.  It tends to be rather 
damaging, but has the drawback that it prevents the monk from hitting in the
round following the chop while recovering.

Chop is a physical attack, and as such, requires the monk be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.

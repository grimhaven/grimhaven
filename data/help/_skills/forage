Forage allows the ranger to gather sustenance while in nature.  When a ranger
forages, the ranger's surroundings will be immediately searched for available
food sources.

Rangers can only forage in nature which generally means outdoors and not in a
city or on a road.  

After foraging, the ranger must wait a few hours for nature to replenish
itself before foraging again.

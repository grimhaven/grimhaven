Syntax: shove <victim> <direction>

Shove is a way to bodily move a person or creature from where they are into an
adjacent location.  It can not be done while either the shover or shovee is
fighting.  The shover can not shove while mounted, nor can a horse be moved
while ridden.  Failed shoves will cause a fight, as will shoves that push the
target into a wall or other non-exit.  Monks have a reputation for dodging
shoves.

Anyone, including the untrained, can attempt to push a rider off their mount.
Success is based on the shover's strength, rider's dexterity and the rider's
control over the mount.  Failure may lead to combat.

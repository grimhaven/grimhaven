Leg block is a basic defensive skill related to the Taedoki Discipline.
In conjunction with Jirin and Arm Block, the old "monk dodge" has been
broken up to involve no only dodging, but also blocking.

Leg block will have some specific effects with respect to unarmed combat,
but in general combat terms, it will provide some damage absorbing
capability.  In conjunction with Shogoki, wearing armored leggings, this
should provide a considerable amount defense.

How this is applied to combat has yet to be coded or even fully
conceptualized.

Note:  Almost all monk disciplines begin with some form of defense versus
that particular type of attack.  One of the things I'm trying to achieve
is a balance where two equally trained monks may neutralize each other
special abilities.

Ritualism allows a shaman greater control of their rituals that they may
use less physical and mental energy in the invokation. Such control
permits them to invoke rituals with components in less important places.
eg, no training requires components in the primary hand, increased
training permits that component to gradually move to the second hand and
then slowly to the spell bag, wristpouch, neckbag, or spell belt.  Such 
training has also been known to yield a higher control over complicated 
ritual.  This allows the shaman to manipulate the invokation in such a way 
that it does maximal effect and gives the prospective victim a lower chance 
to dodge.

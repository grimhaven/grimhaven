Syntax: trance

Truly the pinnacle of a warrior's non-offensive skills, the defensive trance is
a very powerful thing.  It is based on the principal that the best offense is a
good defense, especially if it means giving your buddies a longer amount of
time to beat up on your target.

The defensive trance is based on an advanced form of the parry skill, where the
warrior drops into a deep trance that gives him vastly heightened reaction time
and speed, allowing him parry and block an incredible number of attacks.  The
trance will not work without a weapon, and requires a deep intimacy with the
weapon used.  This also means if your weapon is lost, you will snap out of the
trance.

The percentage of attacks deflected is dependant on countless factors, but
advanced warriors have been known to block as many as two thirds of incoming
blows.  There is, of course, a cost to this increased defense, and that is the
loss of all melee attacks, and the inability to perform all but the most menial
of tasks while in the trance.  It is also possible to lose your concentration
and snap out of the trance without meaning to, although this chance is lessened
while fighting, and by the defender's skill.  It also takes a moment for the
defender to come completely out of his trance, so he is vulnurable for that
time.

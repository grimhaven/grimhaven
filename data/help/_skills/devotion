The more devout a cleric becomes, the less effort is needed to request the
interaction of the cleric's deities upon The World.  This means that a
very undevout cleric might have to hold their holy symbol in their primary
hand, while more devout clerics can gradually move the symbol to their
secondary hand and then to their neck.  Devotion also controls whether the
prayer must be spoken aloud or if it can be thought if the cleric can not 
speak.

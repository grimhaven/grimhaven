Syntax: sacrifice corpse

Shaman are knowledgeable of the ways of life and death. The sacricial 
ritual of blood to the loa will grant you the once owned lifeforce of
a fresh corpse. The allignment between the loa and the shaman are key
during this ritual. If the ancestors are happy with your rada song,
they will grant you some of the once owned lifeforce of the corpse.
If not, then the loa will demand something in return in the form of
lifeforce or possibly even your health. It takes a healthy shaman to
perform this spirit draining ritual.

In order to perform the ritual you will need a suitable totem to be
held in your RIGHT hand. 

// <R>WARNING<z>: If you try to use any command during the sacrifice,
            the loa will take revenge upon you for your lack of
            respect!

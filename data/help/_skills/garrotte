Garrotte is a deadly attack whereby the murderer wraps a specialized wire
around the victim's neck, and attempts to choke them to death.  It takes
time for the victim to run out of oxygen and expire, and their death
throws can often be quite violent.

Obviously, creatures that do not breathe, are not affected by such an attack.
Neck armor is an effective foil against garrotte attacks.

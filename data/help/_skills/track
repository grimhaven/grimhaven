Syntax: track
Syntax: track <creature>
Syntax: toggle hunt

Track will attempt to find a path from your present location to <person>
The distance it will work over is limited by the player's level and skill 
rating.  Doors and other barriers sometimes prevent track from finding a
path.  

Track does not necessarily find a safe path, or even a path that is 
traversable (ie, it could lead over water or through the air).  Track will
locate the closest match it can find, so it may be necessary to refine
your search criteria.

Track with no parameters, or tracking something while already tracking, will
terminate the present track.

Turning the hunt toggle on will cause you to automatically towards the
creature you are tracking.  Note that track does not find a safe path, and
automatically hunting does not do any sanity checks and is perfectly happy
to automatically walk you right off a cliff.  Tracker beware.

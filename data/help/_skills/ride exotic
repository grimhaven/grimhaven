Advanced riding skills represent a deikhans knowledge of a particular type
of mount.  Knowledge in these skills increases riding ability, allows the
use of certain mounted skills and increases their effectiveness.

Exotic mounts are ridable animals that present some special difficulty to
riding (besides wings).  Felines are notoriously difficult to mount, as
are creatures with more than four legs or multiple heads.

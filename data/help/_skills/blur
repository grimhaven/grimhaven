Blur is an extreme focusing of the mind and body during combat which
dramatically increases the number of attacks possible.  This focusing
is difficult to achieve and even experienced monks can not control
when exactly it occurs.  Once a monk has begun training blur
technique, it is attempted constantly while in combat.

Brewing allows the alchemist to create magical potions from base components.

In order to brew, the alchemist will have to gather 3 separate items.  The
first is a simple empty flask suitable for brewing.  Such flasks must have
been specially prepared or the magical properties of the potion will fade,
so not just any flask may be used.  The flask is used to hold the potion.

Secondly, a spell component corresponding to the potion being created must
be obtained.  One charge of the spell component will be utilized during
brewing.

Lastly, a special brew component will also have to be obtained.  The entire
brew component will be used up during the brewing process.

The brewing component serves two purposes during the brewing process.  First
it binds the magical properties of the spell to the liquid.  Secondly,
it serves as a catalyst that permits more than one potion to be created.
The number of potions created during the brewing process is strictly determined
by the quality of the brewing component.

Brewing takes time and concentration.  Any interruption in the process will
destroy the work in progress and the components involved will be useless.

As a warrior, different styles of combat develop as the art of fighting and
combat are passed from generation to generation.  The art of hand to hand
combat teaches offensive as well as defensive types of skills.  Parry is a
defensive maneuver taught to specialized warriors to help keep the fighter
healthy.  This special skill will enable a warrior to avoid an oncomming attack
before it happens. 

While avoiding direct damage to oneself is instinctive, warriors have developed
this instinct into something that is thought about and executed as an
anticipated attack occurs.  It is well known among warriors that the best
offense is a good defense.  Warriors have developed this philosophy and use it
in every battle.

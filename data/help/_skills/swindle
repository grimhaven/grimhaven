Swindling is an attempt to improve the price the thief gets when buying or
selling an item to a shopkeeper by making the thief seem more endearing to
the shopkeeper.  The swindle is handled automatically during the buying
or selling transaction.

Swindling has NO EFFECT on prices quoted when listing or valuing.  If the
swindle is successful, the thief will receive more money then what the item
valued at (or pay less then what it listed at).  Of course there is no way
prior to actually buying or selling the item to know if the swindle is going
to be successful.

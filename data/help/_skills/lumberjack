The lumberjack is one of the most feared creatures of the wild, and with
practice, you can be too!  This skill enables you to harvest logs from the
forested parts of the world using any slashing weapon with the command:

cutlog

Be careful!  Logging is known to be both tiring and hard on weapons (you
might want to carry an extra whetstone for when you are done.)  And every
now and again someone loses an extremity.  Accidents do happen!  So be
prepared!

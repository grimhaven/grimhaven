Syntax: defenenstrate <victim> <window>

Defenestration is the act of hurling someone out of the room through a
window.  Not all windows are appropriately situated for defenestration.

Defenestrate is a physical attack, and as such, requires the monk be
able to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the
attempt to fail.

You must be of roughly the same stature as your victim to successfully hurl
them.

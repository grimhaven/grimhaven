Bodyslam is an attempt to lift an opponent off its feet and throw it bodily
to the ground.  A successful skill roll is required for success, as well as
passing a dexterity check (to grab hold of the target) and strength check
(for lifting off the ground).  Success will knock the wind out of the victim
and leave them on their back.

Bodyslam requires hands to be free or a high degree of brawling
specialization.

Bodyslamming is a physical attack, and as such, requires the bodyslammer be
able to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt
to fail.

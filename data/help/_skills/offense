This skill is slowly learned over time.  Level and Offense skill are the
primary base factors in your hitting percentage in combat.  Offensive
skill has no bearing on how hard you hit just on how well you overcome
your opponents defense.  Other factors that affect hitting ability are
hitroll equipment, certain spells, attack mode, your ability to see, your
dexterity, some minor bonuses for skill with a particular type of weapon,
and your position. 

Most of these factors will not directly add to your hitting ability but
will be factored by the value of your offensive skill.  For example if you
were to obtain a bonus of X hitroll and were at 50% offensive.  You would
get 50% X directly and the other 1/2 X would be multiplied by your 50%
offensive skill.  Thus you would get 75% of X as a bonus. However, be
aware that mage and cleric spells that add hitroll do not rely on your
offensive skill but directly add to your ability to hit.

Note that the offense is a long term skill and as such will most
likely be continually learned throughout your characters career.  Do
not be alarmed if it seems to be going up very slowly.

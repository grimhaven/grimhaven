Martial weapons are a subset of other weapons whose primary characteristic
is that they are simple, light-weight and designed for use with various
oriental fighting styles.  The advantage of a martial weapon is that the
damage of the weapon is added to the attacker's bare-hand damage making such
weapons extremely valuable to monks and other barehand combatants.

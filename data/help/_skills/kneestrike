Kneestrike is a powerful close in strike with the knee.  You can
try to kneestrike almost any opponent, but what area of your opponent
you hit is dependent on your relative heights.  It can be particularly
effective on the crotch area or the head.  

Damage is determined by the attackers level.  Unusually skilled
attackers will hit easier, cause more damage and become less exhausted.

Kneestrike is a physical attack, and as such, requires the attacker be
able to successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt
to fail.

Syntax: repair <item>

All shamans learn the lore and the nature of death and undead
creatures, and this mastery of the non-living allows shamans
to repair some of the damage done to equipment made of such
materials.

The appropriate tools must be held and in the room and the item
you wish to repair must be in your inventory in order to repair
it.


Shamans are skilled at mending equipment made of dead organic
material:

Tools necessary:
 Primary:   scalpel
 Secondary: foreceps
 In-room:   operating table

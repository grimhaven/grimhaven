Syntax: toggle limbs

The limbs command is used to view the health of yours or someone else's limbs.

Severely damaged limbs may become useless and inoperable.  Inoperable limbs
will cause you obvious problems (inability to cast spells requiring gestures, 
inability to hold weapons, problems standing or walking).

Additionally, limbs may have afflictions (bleeding, infected, paralyzed).  
These afflictions may cause problems as time goes by (an arm that continues to
bleed may cause blood loss and eventual death if not treated, a foot with
an infection may rot and fall off).

Combat damage is the most common way limbs become damaged, but certain
spells can have devastating affects as well.  Time will heal damage
but not major afflictions.  It is a good idea to have critical damage
looked at by a cleric or physician.  Physicians can be found in most of 
the major towns and cities of The World.

Using the limbs toggle will allow you to automatically evaluate the tank's
limbs after every battle.

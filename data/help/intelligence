Intelligence represents a player's knowledge and intellect.  It is a
reflection of what might be termed "book learning" unencumbered by
practical experience.

In game terms, intelligence is examined whenever a "smartness" check is
needed.  Is is generally closely associated with wisdom since one
generally needs both theoretical knowledge (int) and practical knowledge
(wis).  It also is used to determine the number of practices received
when leveling.

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for their 
travels, and where they may sell their treasure if they should manage to
survive the perils with their life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality.

Shops on <h> are different from what you are probably used to on other
MUDs.  Our shops here on <h>, save their contents through crashes and 
reboots. What this means is once an item is sold to a shopkeeper, they will
have that item until it sells to someone else.  Also, once it is bought
the shop won't have it again until someone sells it back to them.  Certain
items that the shopkeepers 'produce' which they have an 'infinite' supply.
Most items though, are not this way, and are sold/bought just like a real
shop would.

Shops typically will not purchase items for the same rate that they sell them.
Consider your purchases carefully, shop around for the best price, and make
sure you know what the item does before you waste money on it.

Prices will fluctuate over time and will be influenced by the general
economy.  Items that don't sell well maybe put on sale which is designated
by a (*) next to their price.

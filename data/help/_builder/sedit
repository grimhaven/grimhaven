Breakdown:

Syntax: SEDIT modify <mobile>
    The SEDIT menu interface is the cleanest way to interact with this system.
  But is not the only way.  Avoid using the command line until you have a good
  grasp of the menu system though.

  Ex:
    SEDIT modify elite-cityguard

Syntax: SEDIT add <mobile> <{trigger}> <entry>
    This will add <{trigger}> to <mobile>, if it doesn't exist, and append
  <entry> at the end of the trigger's block.  At current there is no way to
  insert an entry partway through a trigger from the command line.  So if you
  mess up you will need to enter the menu system and modify it from there.

  Ex:
    SEDIT add elite-cityguard {say hello} say what might I do for you?

Syntax: SEDIT delete <mobile> <{trigger}> <entry>
    If you do not define <entry> then the entire <{trigger}> is deleted.  Else
  just <entry>, should it exist in <{trigger}>, is removed From <{trigger}>.

  Ex:
    SEDIT delete elite-cityguard {say hello}
    SEDIT delete elite-cityguard {say hello} say what might I do for you?

Syntax: SEDIT display <mobile> <tofind>
    This is a quick and easy way to check for what triggers are on your mobile.
  There is a variety of ways to utilize this extension:

  Ex:
    SEDIT display elite-cityguard
    SEDIT display elite-cityguard hello
    SEDIT display elite-cityguard -say

Syntax: SEDIT save <mobile>
    This will save down all the current triggers on <mobile> to your personal
  directory.  These files are archived based on what the mobile number is.  So
  if you create a mob make sure to Med Save it and Med Load it so the number
  is appropriate to the mobile.

  Ex:
    SEDIT save elite-cityguard

Syntax: SEDIT load <mobile>
    This will load up any triggers that can be found for <mobile> in you
  personal directory.

  Ex:
    SEDIT load elite-cityguard

Syntax: SEDIT clear <mobile>
    This will clear all triggers that are on <mobile> And remove any triggers
  you might have stored for it in your personal directory.  Once removed you
  Can Not Get Them Back.  So use this with extreme caution.

  Ex:
    SEDIT clear elite-cityguard

Syntax: SEDIT list
    This will go through your personal directory and list all trigger files
  that exist indexed by mobile vnum.  This means if you have a mobile,
    a big hairy ogre [saved under vnum 15900]
  and you have triggers for it then It's triggers will be listed under:
    15900 # A big hairy ogre

Syntax: SEDIT purge
    This will remove *ALL* stored scripts in your directory.  Every last one
  of them.  This will permanently remove them.  That means after this you Can
  Not Get Them Back.  So use this with extreme caution.

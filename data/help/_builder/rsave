Syntax: rsave <1/2>
Syntax: rsave backup <1/2>

  This command is used to save your work so you can come back to it later
should something happen to the mud, such as a crash or a reboot.

  You can use 'goto help' to get a list of your blocks (and other information).
To save your PRIMARY room block, do "rsave" or "rsave 1".  To save your
SECONDARY room block, do "rsave 2".

  If you fail to rsave your rooms and we crash the work you had is lost for
good.  So make sure to rsave whenever you finish a decent amount of work.

  Everytime you perform an rsave a backup file is automatically made.  But
you can also create a 'special backup' by using the 2nd Syntax.  These both
can be then loaded through rload.

  ALWAYS RLOAD BEFORE RSAVING!  Saving an empty set of rooms will give you
exactly that, and that's almost never what you want.

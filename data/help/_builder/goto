  This wizard command allows you to move about without walking.  You
can either supply a room VNUM, a player name, a monster name
(lamia, 34.lamia), or an object name (corpse, 5.corpse).  You will
disappear and reappear in the target room.

  If a room is flagged PRIVATE and there is more than one person in
it, additional people will not be able to GOTO there.  Get an
inhabitant to TRANSFER you in.

MED SAVE

  The save function is used to save an edited mobile to disk. The syntax
for this is :
 
   med save <mobile name> <vnum>

Mobile name is just simply the name of the mobile you want to save. Vnum
is the number you assign the mobile to save to disk with. This should
be the vnum you want it to be when it gets in the real mob file.

MED LOAD

  The load function is used to retrieve any saved mobile from disk. The syntax
for this is :
  
  med load <vnum>

So if you save a mobile as vnum 29, and later you want to reload that mobile 
for testing purposes, you would type med load 29.

MED MODIFY

   The modify function will put you in a full screen VT100 mobile editor.
This is where you can edit your mobs to save them like you want for your 
areas.

  med modify <mob name>

MED LIST
  
   The list function will list out every mob you have saved on disk for
easy reference.

  med list

MED REMOVE

   The remove function will remove certain mobs from disk. The syntax is :

   med remove <vnum>

   Once removed, the mobs are gone, so don't use this unless you are sure
you want to remove it.

MED CREATE

   Unlike OEDIT, there is no "create" option for mobs.  You should consider
using a mob similar to the one you are attempting to create, loading that
mob (load m xxx), and modifying it as appropriate.  You may wish to use the
testmobs (load m testmob-lx) where x is a number from 1-50 as these mobs are
kept with statistics of exactly the level in question.

Notes : All commands can be abbreviated. I.e. 
   med mo gnome is the same thing as med modify gnome. 

MED FACTION

  When setting faction you do:
    med faction mobile FACTION_TYPE FACTION_PERCENT

MED BARE_HAND

  Setting bare hand damage through the command line is the same as in
  the editor:
    med bare_hand mobile DICEdSIZE+BONUS
    med bare_hand elite 3d10+3

MED REPLACE

  This allows you to search for a string in either long or description and
  replace it with something else.
    med replace <mobile> <long/desc> <"text"> <"text">
  The "" are Required to keep the strings separate.

MED RESAVE

  If you med load a mobile to make changes and wish to save it back under
  the vnum you initially saved it under this is the directive for you. It
  will auto-save back to the proper vnum instead of you having to specify
  it again.

MED AVERAGE

  By using this command you can average a mob to match a specific level.
  Certain things factor into this formula so it isn't a perfect matchup but
  will get incredibly close to the desired level.

  Syntax:
    med average <mobile> <level> <class>
  Note:
    The <class> field is fully optional.  If you specify a class then it
  will set the chosen stats of the mobile to some basic 'class similar'
  values.

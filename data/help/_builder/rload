Syntax: rload <1/2>
Syntax: rload backup <1/2> <"standard">

  This command allows you to load previous work that you have RSAVED to
continue working on it.  If you failed to rsave before then this command
will not work as you might expect it to.

  In combination with the backup files created with rsave it is possible
to load either the standard or builder backups at your whim:
  rload backup 1
    ::Will load backups made by rsave backup for block1.
  rload backup 1 standard
    ::Will load backups made by rsave for block1.

  In general the backup extension is usually not used unless you really
mess up.

  Use 'goto help' to get a list of your blocks.  Use 'rload 1' to load your
PRIMARY block, and 'rload 2' to load your SECONDARY block.

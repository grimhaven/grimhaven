OEDIT SAVE

  The save function is used to save an edited object to disk. The syntax
for this is :
 
   OEDIT save <object name> <vnum>

Object name is just simply the name of the object you want to save. Vnum
is the number you assign the object to save to disk with. This should
be the vnum you want it to be when it gets in the real object file.

OEDIT LOAD

  The load function is used to retrieve any saved object from disk. The syntax
for this is :
  
  OEDIT load <vnum>

So if you save an object as vnum 29, and later you want to reload that object
for testing purposes, you would type OEDIT load 29.

OEDIT MODIFY

   The modify function will put you in a full screen VT100 object editor.
This is where you can edit your objects to save them like you want for your 
areas.

  OEDIT modify <object name>

OEDIT LIST
  
   The list function will list out every object you have saved on disk for
easy reference.

  OEDIT list

OEDIT REMOVE

   The remove function will remove certain objects from disk. The syntax is :

   OEDIT remove <vnum>

   Once removed, the objects are gone, so don't use this unless you are sure
you want to remove it.

OEDIT CREATE

   The create function will create a prototype object that you can edit
as you like and save to disk. These objects cannot be used by anyone.
 
   OEDIT create

Notes : All commands can be abbreviated. I.e. 
   OEDIT mo potion is the same thing as OEDIT modify potion. 

OEDIT EXTRA

  Add/Modify extra descriptions.  If no argument is passed, objects current
name is used.  If you enter a name that already exists it will display it
to you then let you modify it.  Be careful, once you choose to modify an
existing extra description the original text Will Be Lost.  To remove an
extra description please use the menu interface of OEDIT.

  OEDIT extra <object> argument-names
    Ex:
  OEDIT extra hairball hairball small

OEDIT DEFAULT_AC_STR

  Set the AC STR of a piece of armor to default values.  Values are more
  accurate at higher levels but pretty close at lower ones.

  OEDIT default_ac_str <object> <level>

OEDIT REPLACE

  This allows you to search for a string in either long or extra and
  replace it with something else.
    OEDIT replace <object> <long/extra> <"extra"/"text"> <"text"> <"text">
  The "" are Required to keep the strings separate.
    Types:
  OEDIT replace <object> <long> <"text"> <"text">
  OEDIT replace <object> <extra> <"extra"> <"text"> <"text">

OEDIT RESAVE

  If you OEDIT load an object to make changes and wish to save it back under
  the vnum you initially saved it under this is the directive for you. It
  will auto-save back to the proper vnum instead of you having to specify
  it again.

OEDIT AVERAGE

  Some object types can be averaged out, examples of this being weapons
  and armor.  By using this command you can set general values to make
  those objects equal to the level you request.

  Syntax:
    OEDIT average <object> <level>

Room flags are used by the code to set room affects on PC's.  Most of the 
affects are pretty obvious from the name of the room flag.

You should edit room flags in REDIT where you can see the full extent 
of flags available to you.  However, if you know the numbers, you 
may be able to set them using the Edit command.  Be aware that room flags 
are bitvectors.

Some sectors require certain room flags notably indoor room sectors 
require you to set the indoor room flag.  Also do not set a peace room 
without making it no-heal.  Do not make death rooms or save rooms 
without the explicit approval of the LOW and do not make any permanent 
rooms in the mud private.

Syntax: message list

  The message command allows you to setup various message throughout the game,
that pertain to you, to something other than the default type.  

  'message list' lists all the fields that correspond to powers that you have,
and their current settings.  The possible fields are:

        title : Special title used by some upper immortals
        purge : General purge message shown to room
 purge-target : Message people see when you purge a mobile specifically
        rload : Message people see in a room you change with rload
  load-object : Message people see when you load an object
  load-mobile : Message people see when you load a mobile
        MEDIT : Message people see when you load a mobile through MEDIT
        OEDIT : Message people see when you load an object through OEDIT
switch-target : Message display to-room on 'switch load <monster>'
      move-in : Message displayed to people when you move in The World
                  north, southeast, up, down
       *** What people see when you Leave a room
     move-out : Message displayed to people when you move in The World
                  the north, the southeast, above, below
       *** What people see when you Enter a room
         slay : Message others see when you slay something
  slay-target : Message target sees when you slay them
        force : Message people see when you force them to do something.


  Now keep in mind that not all fields are available to you.  If you don't have
the command(s) related to the message then you will be unable to set the
message.

These are things that can be used in the messages:
  Any color code.
  <<n> = Your name.
  <<N> = Target name, when applicable mobile or object.
  <<a> = Arguments, used in 'force'
  <<d> = Direction of travel, used in move-in/move-out
  <<m> = him, her, it based on your sex.
  <<M> = him, her, it based on Target's sex.
  <<e> = he, she, it based on your sex.
  <<E> = he, she, it based on Target's sex.
  <<s> = his, her, its based on your sex.
  <<S> = his, her, its based on Target's sex.

  Now some fields require some of the above codes to work properly.  Also not
all of the fields can be used in every instance.  Example is the sex terms based
on target's sex in a field like 'move-in/move-out' where there Is no target.

  Another important thing to remember is that:
1) You DO NOT have to set these.  If you wish there are default ones for
   all of them that work just fine.
2) You may or may not be able to set some of these.  If your curious just try
   setting it and if you cannot it'll let you know.
3) Color codes do not count towards field length but do count towards total
   length.  Ex:
     message title Jack of Trades       <- this is legal
     message title Jack of all Trades   <- this is illegal(title is max 14)
     message title <r>Jack<z> of Trades <- this is legal

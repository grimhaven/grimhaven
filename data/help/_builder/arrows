Arrow Type for both arrows and bows is used to keep a little
bit of logic in sizes:

Type 0 : Long Stalk    : Hunting Arrows   (Long  Range)
     1 : Short Stalk   : Fighting Arrows  (Close Range)
     2 : Long Quarrel  : Squabble Fights  (Long  Range)
     3 : Short Quarrel : Common Crossbow  (Close Range)
     4 : Long Dart     : Sniper Blowgun   (Long  Range)
     5 : Short Dart    : Common Blowgun   (Close Range)
     6 : Large Pellet  : Heavy Slingshot  (Long  Range)
     7 : Small Pellet  : Common Slingshot (Close Range)

A bow cannot be used to fire an arrow unless the arrow types
on both are the same.

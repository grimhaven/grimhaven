Syntax:
  zonefile
  zonefile <directive>

  This command is used to handle the various online work that revolves
around the zonefile.

                         **** PLEASE READ *****
  This command (zonefile save) causes drastic lag on the mud even on a
small zone.  So PLEASE Do Not Use this during peak times but instead
wait until there are few people on or when you think you can sneak it
in without much affect.
                         **********************

  With zonefile it will create a basic zonefile and email it to the address
noted on your account.  Notes:
  Things that will be recorded in the zonefile:
    'D' commands depending on if a door is closed and/or locked.
    'O' commands for Objects in rooms set no-take.
    'P' commands to put objects in 'O' objects.
    'B' commands for Objects in rooms set take.
    'P' commands to put objects in 'B' objects.
    'M' commands for Mobiles in rooms.
    'G' commands for Objects in Mobiles.
    'E' commands for Objects Equipped by Mobiles.
  Things Not recorded or checked for in the zonefile:
    Objects in Objects in/equipped-by mobiles
    'R' commands for ride directives.
    'C' & 'K' commands for charm/group directives.
    'H' & 'F' commands for hate/fear directives.
    'T' commands for trap setting.
    'V' commands for 4-value modifications.
    '?' commands for randomizer directive.
    'Y' commands for bulk-suit loads.
    'A' commands for area randomizer directive.
    'X' & 'Z' commands for local bulk-suit setting/loading.

  Keep in mind this command is Not a way to skip the zonefile process.  It
  is simply a way to make it easier for you by doing a lot of the grunt work
  and leaving the technical details to you.

  Note that the O, P, B, M, G and E commands rely on the vnum that the object
  was loaded under: [pretend session]
    load obj 100  <- Lets say this is a 'black-collar-dog'
    OEDIT save black-collar-dog 101
    drop black-collar-dog
    OEDIT load 101
    drop black-collar-dog
    zonefile save
  In this example you would have 2 Objects saved down.  One would be obj
  100 and the other 101.  Why?  Because the first object was Not an OEDIT load
  of 101.  Make Sure to OEDIT/med load your objects before doing the save and
  not rely on just 'loading, modifying, saving, dropping and saving.





zonefile save
  Used to save the current stat of one of your zone blocks.  It saves
  the zonefile to the zone you are Currently In.

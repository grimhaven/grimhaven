Need assistance:  The "Lord of Worlds" is your best bet as he is directly
responsible for helping you to finish your zone.  You should also contact
him in order to obtain the most updated copy of the docs  (now available
on-line). Take a look at the Begginners Book to Building for a tutorial
to help you get started.

For quick questions, proofreading, brainstorming and the like almost any
god will do.  Most high level gods have finished an area themselves so can
handle technical questions.  Consultation with players is permitted regarding
what "items are needed".

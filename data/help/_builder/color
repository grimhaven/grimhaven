Currently supported <categories>:
    enabled, disabled - turns the use of all colors on/off
    communications, objects, creatures, rooms, room_name shouts, spells -
          turns the use of color in these categories on/off.
    every, none - turns all categories on/off

Immortals also have the following two options: codes and logs.  Logs is
self explanatory.  Codes will skip color code replacement and stripping
and will actually let you see the color codes in the text.

Users with Ansi-capable monitors and terminal emulation may take advantage
of <h>'s color.  Color has been organized into categories so that
people who like some things colored and not others, can customize as
desired.  Additionally, hard to see colors may be replaced with ones more
easily viewed.


To see any color at all, you must enable the basic color.  (The enabled
option).  You can extend color by additionally activating other categories
of color.  For instance, to see colorized objects, turn color objects on.
The "every" and "none" options can be used to quickly turn the whole list
of categories on or off.

The "test" option can be quickly used to see how given colors display on
your terminal. 

The "room_name" option will give you extra color in room names.  Basic
room name which comes with the basic color package (color enabled)

Additionally, you can replace any color difficult to see, and substitute
it with one more easily viewed.  You may replace as many colors as you
wish, but all replaced colors will use the same substitute color. 
Syntax: color replace <color>
Syntax: color substitute <color>
Where <color> is one of:
none, black, red, green, orange, blue, purple, cyan, white, yellow, gray,
bold_red, bold_green, bold_blue, bold_purple, bold_cyan, bold_white, and
bold.

To clear a color replace or substitute you can toggle the color or use
the <none> option

It is recommended that if you do NOT have color capability, that you not
enable any of the color settings.  It both consumes processing time for
the mud, as well as requires more information be sent to you.  This
effects your character's performance. 

We also allow you to colorize elements of your output to the mud. 
Currently, most of *your* output text (say, shout, tell) can be colorized
by you as well as your titles.  Thus you can say, shout, whisper, and tell
in color. You can also use color in notes and mail.  For help on how to
colorize text, see HELP COLOR STRING. 

If you feel something should (or should not be colorized), please feel
free to make use of the IDEA command.

Finally, <h> uses the ANSI standard for transmission of color to the
end user.  Only a terminal program or client capable of interpreting the
ANSI color strings will be able to make sense of the color codes
output.  If you find that not all colors are showing up, it is most
likely due to your communications software, and not <h>.  Also, the
ANSI standard does NOT the properties of "red", "green" etc.  Depending on
the program, you may observe changes (hue, intensity, etc) in how they
each display the various colors.  Not all communications programs support
all ANSI options.  Window 95 shell-account users might wish to use NetTerm
4.2.1 or the <h> client.

   Edit allows you to edit rooms without going through the REDIT 
full screen editor.  Do not use edit unless you are familiar with 
REDIT and capable of fixing any errors you make in The World.  If 
capable, edit allows a quick and easy way of performing some building 
tasks.  Its disadvantages are that it doesn't provide you the explanations 
of REDIT nor does it have menus that serve as room building checklists.

   Edit does not do every aspect of <h> 4.x room building.  It is also 
the only way you can currently create a teleport room and a number of other
things.

   Edit, like REDIT, edits the room that you are currently in.  Also like
REDIT you can edit any room, but the changes will not be permanent.  They
will be lost and the mud will reset the next reboot or crash.  If you need
to save them you can use the rsave, and rload commands to save your
changes into a file, and reload them later into the game, (if it crashes,
for example).  CAUTION: Do not rsave or rload unless you know what you 
are doing.

NOTE: If you are confused by this, and try it anyway, you may crash
    the game.  Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.
    Also, try to avoid making too many changes to the existent areas
    for the moment.

Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it. this
does not create rooms, only edits them.  Contact the LOW if you need
an area assigned to you.  Also ask him any questions that you have
about room editing.

REDIT with arguments will be passed onto edit:
  REDIT name The Office of Nue
    becomes
  edit name The Office of Nue

This will cause you to become invisible or to become visible again to
creatures.  While invis you will not appear on the who list and folks
will not be able to tell to you.  Invisible immortal's actions generally
show up as either a Someone does/says or do not appear to mortals at all.

Invisible generally takes an argument which is what level you wish to be 
invisible at.

>invis 12
This will cause all creatures 11th level and below to treat you as invis.
You could type invis 55 and go invisible to gods too (this is generally
inconsiderate though)

>invis
This is the same as typing invis 51  (invisible to mortals)

Note: One of Brutius's pet peeves is gods who spend lots of time invisible.
If you are on as an immortal, be visible and handle complaints.  There is
no shame in telling someone "I'm busy but if you can wait 5 minutes I can
help you".  Going invis while you work on an area or code in another window
is acceptable.

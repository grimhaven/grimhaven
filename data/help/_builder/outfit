Syntax: outfit <mobile> <object>

  This will allow you to equip a mobile with an object you have previously
created.  This is mainly geared towards assisting in the zonefile creation
process but can have other applications.

You've Been Warned:
  Do not use this command on mortals.
  Do not use this on mobiles in the active world.
  Do not use this on a mobile then move them to the active world.
    You can not do these things anyways but keep in mind that this is not the
    purpose of this command.

Need To Know:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Just like the mortal outfit command this command determines, based on object
wear flags, where the object should be placed.  But unlike the mortal outfit
command this will place objects without wear flags in the mobiles inventory.
Keep in mind that outside of switch/give and the like there is no quick way to
retrieve objects from mobiles.  Make absolutely sure you have saved(OEDIT save)
the object first and have also loaded(OEDIT load) the object to verify it's
number is correct.  Failure to do this will have bad results when you try and
save your zonefile.

Important:
  When doing this to setup a zone for the 'save zonefile' command make sure you
have saved down and Re-Loaded(OEDIT load) all the objects.  Otherwise the numbers
Will Not Be Correct.

Notes:
  This command requires that the wizpower 'Imm-Outfit' be set on you.  If you do
not have this power and need it then seek a god who has the power to set you with
it.  This is usually best to be asked of a Low.

Sector types are used by the code to set room affects on PC's.  The type 
of sector you set will now or in the future affect moves, weather, scanning, 
ranged weapons, lighting, and tiredness.  It also affects whether a room 
is an air or a water room requiring fly or waterbreath/swim.

You should edit sector types in REDIT where you can see the full extent 
of Sector types available to you.  However, if you know the numbers, you 
may be able to set them using the Edit command.

Some sectors require certain room flags notably indoor room sectors 
require you to set the indoor room flag.

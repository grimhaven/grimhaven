Syntax: remove <item> {person}
Syntax: remove <slot>
Syntax: remove all
Syntax: remove all.damaged

Remove is used to take an <item> off (remove from equipment).  Generally,
<item> must be visible to be removed, although in low light conditions,
you may specify merely the body slot you wish to remove equipment from.

Note that the following formats are all valid:
	wrist, wrist-right, wrist-left

Note that the 'held' slots are formatted like:
        hold (defaults to primary hand) hold-right hold-left

The 'remove all' variation will remove all equipment quickly.
The 'remove all.damaged' variation will remove any damaged equipment.

You can optionally specify a {person} to remove the <item> from.  This is
essentially the reverse of outfit.  This only works if {person} will let you
remove their equipment (enthralled, a pet, a captive, etc).

You will not be able to remove some items while in combat but can
disengage to remove them.  Sometimes removing items can add command
lockout and can place the remover in a position which he can't hit for a
small period of time.

Syntax: remove <arrow> <bow>
An arrow loaded into a bow may be removed this way.  Note that <bow> must
be held for this to work.

Syntax: whisper <person> <message>

A generic way to communicate with other people in <h>.
Some rooms will prevent this command due to a magical dweomer of silence.

Whisper will transmit a message to the person referenced and in addition
lets everyone in the room know that a conversation is going on, but not
what was said.
   EX: whisper joeblow quiet down, we're in a library

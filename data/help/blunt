Blunt weapons are large non-edged weapons generally used for pounding on
creatures.  Hammers, clubs and the like are good examples.  Any weapon
that: POUNDS, BLUDGEONS, SMITES, SMASHES, PUMMELS, FLAILS, BEATS, THRASHES,
WHIPS, THUMPS, WALLOPS, BATTERS, STRIKES, CLUBS or CRUSHES is a blunt weapon.

Blunt weapons are good at pounding on hard creatures, but are not so
effective against protection like leather since it has some flexibility
to it.  Metal armor takes a real beating (no pun intended) from blunt
weapons.  It is conceivable that certain porous, or squishy creatures
would be able to absorb the hammer blow without taking visible damage.

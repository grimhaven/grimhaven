Syntax: junk <item>

If you feel an item is so worthless that it isn't even worth dropping and
leaving for some other lucky adventurer to find, use the junk command.  
Junk will totally destroy the object with no chance of recovery.

!!!!!!! NOTE !!!!!!!!!!!!
No reimbursement is given for junking something by accident, be explicit
when you type junk so that typos do not cause problems.  We have spent
some time trying to coordinate object manipulation and junk, but
regardless, there is no reimbursement if the coordination is off.

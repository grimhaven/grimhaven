The following takes effect upon any link-loss:

If you are following someone, you will cease to follow.  This will also
shatter any grouping relationship.  Magically charmed creatures will not
stop following as a result of this.

If you have pets or other NPC charms, they will have their save file removed.
That is, the pet (and any equipment of the pet) remains in the game.  If you
do not go back into the game, the pet will be lost.

Combat normally ceases, although only after you take one more hit.  Since
this is easily abused, although necessary to prevent obvious problems,
see below for how such situations are handled.

----------------------------------------------
As many people felt compelled to attempt to avoid death by losing link
at opportune moments, <h> has attempted to counteract this method
of cheating with some unique code.

Should you be linkdead and involved in a fight (either by dumping link
while still fighting, or by having an angry mob track down your linkless
body), the game will automatically rescue you.  The penalty for this is
that (depending on how damaged you were), the game may confiscate your
equipment and inventory.  Any confiscated items are placed in a holding
room together with the details of what triggered the confiscation.
You will need to seek out a god to reclaim them as well as be sanctioned
if it is warranted.

The moral of the story : don't lose link to avoid death, it will
be much more hassle than it's worth.

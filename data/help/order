Syntax: order <follower> <command>
Syntax: order <all | followers> <command>
Syntax: order <all | follower | followers> "return"

Order can be used to make an NPC do your bidding.  Only those creatures
actively following you will respond.  Note that undead thralls will
accept any order without question, but other beings have a modest
sense of self-preservation while charmed.  Hence ridden creatures or
pets may refuse some orders.

The order followers <command> will make all of your followers do the
same thing simultaneously.  Alternatively, you can do: order all <command>.

Order "return" must be typed in full. It will cause followers to release
themselves from your control in various ways.  Elementals will return to
planes, charms will break charm, etc.

Syntax: grab <object> {left | right}
Syntax: hold <object> {left | right}

The grab and hold commands are synonymous and are used to put
<object> into your hand.  The {left} and {right} parameters may
be used to specify which hand explicitly, but if ignored will
cause the <object> to be put into a free hand, starting with the
primary hand.

Certain items are two-handed and hence must be held in both hands.

It is recommended that you use your primary hand for your weapon and
use your second hand for utility purposes (shield, lantern, 2nd weapon).

You are able to hold something provided that you are strong enough to
swing it about (a function of your strength).  Note that your primary
hand has a higher capacity for held weight than secondary.

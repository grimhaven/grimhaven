In ANSI or VT100 terminal modes, <h> will generate a status bar
at the bottom of your screen and fill it with useful game statistics
to help you better keep track of things.

The ANSI status bar has color as well as features a graphical representation
of your hit points.  ie. the number of '>'s change color so that as your
stat drops, the bar decreases.

Both status bars contain the following information:  health, mana, move,
talens, exp, faction percentage, opponent prompt (while fighting only) in
the lower left, real-time clock in the lower right and a game-time clock
in the lower middle representing the time of day that the mud is at.

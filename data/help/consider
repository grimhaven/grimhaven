Usage : consider <monster>

This command will initially only provide a comparison of your level versus 
the monster being considered.  This is a VERY ROUGH estimate of the degree of
difficulty.  More information may be obtained by improving your consider 
skills.  A certain person skilled in the ways of monsters around Grimhaven
can help improve your ability to consider.

Know that on balance we expect a solo player in a fair fight to lose as
often as they win.  As the player increases in level and can be expected
to group more, fair fight mobiles will become stronger than players.  The
class of the player and his opponent will also throw off the value of the
consider command in any given circumstance. One class's fair fight maybe
another's easy fight. Another could find the opponent unkillable.

This means that the consider command should not be used as a predictor of
whether you will win or lose but will just give you some information about
your foe.

You can also consider yourself to get an idea if your current armor is right
for you.

Syntax: gain reset

If you have spent practices accidentally or just changed your mind, you can
always reset your practices at your guildmaster.

Resetting practices allows you to zero out your present disciplines (except those
that are learned automatically). After resetting, you will have to go
back to your trainers and re-practice.

Your skill learnedness before the reset will not be altered, so re-gaining a
discipline after a reset will restore your current level of learnedness.

There is a cost associated with this service.  Your guildmaster will tell you
how much if you use the 'gain' command.

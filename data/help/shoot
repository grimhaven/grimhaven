Syntax: shoot <direction> <creature> <distance>

Shoot is the command used to shoot bows.  Shooting properly takes some
training and not everyone is able to shoot well. 

If no <direction> is specified, you will shoot at the first such <person>
seen in the directions: n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw

The <distance> parameter allows you to force the arrow to stop looking for
targets after going <distance>.  eg. if there is a peasant 2 squares away
and another one 7 squares and you want to ignore the furthest one, you would
do: SHOOT <dir> PEASANT 3

You must have previously loaded (BLOAD) your bow with an arrow.  Different
bows are capable of different maximum ranges.

The amount of learning will set what kind of weapon you can shoot.
Players do not start with bow knowledge but must develop that
through the learning system.

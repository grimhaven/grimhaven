    =======================================================================
01-26-01 : As some of you may have noticed, the base stats for a few player
           races have changed.  This change was not intended to go in yet,
           but it IS balanced - any negatives you noticed are balanced with
           positives. 
01-24-01 : You will now see the key used when you unlock a door.
01-20-01 : The donate command has been disabled.
01-18-01 : There have been some adjustments to the way stats affect stuff.
           In general, it allows for a wider ranger of stats, however this
           means that most of you will notice that your good stats give you
           less of a bonus... this does work the other way, bad stats give
           you less of a penalty.  Well, it works, don't worry about it.
01-18-01 : Repair times are longer now, and dependant on how much damage
           your equipment has taken.  This will make smythe more valuable,
           and is more along the lines of how repair used to be. 
01-11-01 : The world command will now show your network lag.  This number
           is a measurement of the speed of your connection to the mud.
01-08-01 : There has been a change in the way height mod equipment works.
           It does *not* make you grow (or shrink), enabling you to wear
           clothes you normally could not.  That was just silly.  But it does
           effect things like where your special hits land, if you can or
           can't use a special on someone, etc.
01-06-01 : Fixed Holy Devastator Quest toggle problem
01-03-01 : Tweak in damage code will lower damage done in arena fights.
           This should add an element of strategy to arena fighting, rather
           than just sitting back and watching. This will also take effect
           in some PkQuest battles.
01-03-01 : Brawn will also effect limb damage rates.
01-01-01 : Flying mobs should now wait till their lockout clears before
           flying again.
01-01-01 : Brawn has an effect on combat now, brawny characters will suffer
           less than others, and find themselves less susceptible to harm.
12-30-00 : Vella Island finally added after 2+ years of sitting around
           ready to go! Should be pretty much debugged, but hard to
           get to unless you stumble upon the entrance to the zone...
12-22-00 : NEW WARRIOR SKILL: The defensive trance will allow a warrior to
           gain an greatly increased parry ability at cost of offensive
           attacks.  Help defensive trance, or trance, for details.
12-07-00 : Steal bug fixed.  Mobs will react to failed steals again.
11-20-00 : Objects will now catch on fire when exposed to flame, such as
	   flamestrike.  Objects may be dropped on the ground and extinguished
	   or you or someone else may pour water on you to extinguish burning
           equipment.  Also, horses poop.
11-08-00 : WARRIOR SKILL REVISION: The smythe skill has been enabled. The 
           skill does need some work to it but it is functional. Read help
           smythe for details and for updates to the skill. I will try to 
           keep updates for smythe in the help file so I don't clog up news
           with the same stuff.
11-04-00 : NEW WARRIOR SKILL: Power move will enable a warrior to find the
           weakest point in an opponents body and focus a concentrated hit
           to that point. Read help Power Move for more details.
10-31-00 : Reduced player affect on quivering palm to what it was originally
           when the skill was introduced to the mud. Enjoy.
10-25-00 : NEW WARRIOR SKILL: Dual wield for Warriors was added to the
           Physical Skills disc. Yes, this is a lame place for Dual Wield
           to go however I will be looking to rearrange some of the Warrior
           discs and skills as time goes on. This placement is only 
           temporary.
10-23-00 : There is no longer a height restriction on cudgel if you are
           flying.
10-22-00 : Saddlebag type saddles are in - help saddle, get, put for the
           details on usage.
10-22-00 : NEW WARRIOR SKILL: Spin skill will enable a warrior to daze
           an opponent for a brief time. Read help spin for details.
10-21-00 : A failed steal will now cause you to stop sneaking.
10-20-00 : A message will now be displayed when an item arrives in surplus.
10-20-00 : Paralyze bite/spit mobs will no longer reparalyze you the same
           round you wake up.  Hooooray.
10-20-00 : Added checks for charge against flying mobs without a flying
           mount.  Also added a crit success.
10-20-00 : Hitting people with spiked things now does damage. For example, 
           kicking someone with a spiked boot will hurt more, as might be
           expected.
10-17-00 : Cudgel changes, now it is sane.  Sorry for any that suffer the
           whines of a certain outspoken elf.  Help cudgel for details.
09-29-00 : NEW WARRIOR SKILL: Parry skill will enable a warrior to avoid
           some hits. This much resembles the thief dodge skill but alas
           something new for warriors.
09-26-00 : Added dumb trolley that moves between Grimhaven and Brightmoon.
           Enjoy.
08-31-00 : Removed mount restrictions for Solo Quest Toggle. You may now
           use mounts on a solo quest.
08-14-00 : Removed negative light bonus from shadowy eq, in favor of 
           visibility bonus.  Negative light is dumb.
07-26-00 : Trophy has been disabled.  It will be rewritten to address some
           of the issues that we talked about and then tested again.
07-17-00 : The beginnings of a trophy system are now in place.  Read help
           trophy for details.  THE TROPHY SYSTEM IS NOT ACTIVE AT THIS TIME.
           Everything that is in now is only for your input before going live.
07-17-00 : Light has been added to basic room looking.
07-13-00 : It has come to my attention that the monk sash ac's are not
           correct.  I'm not sure if there was a formula change or what,
           but in any case they should be correct now.  This only affects
           green and red.
07-10-00 : Monk red sash quest is in.
07-07-00 : Thief dodge is now implemented.
06-09-00 : Rate of opposed faction aggroing has been cut down
           somewhat.  This should give you a slightly better chance of
           escaping. 
06-02-00 : get all all.corpse should work now, for real.
05-31-00 : You will now be charged, at most, 1 full days worth of rent, when
           renting.  This should give more flexibility to players who don't
           play every day.
05-27-00 : The citizens of Logrus and Brightmoon have begun protecting
           their respective cities from players of opposing factions.
05-27-00 : Clerics will no longer be penalized for healing players in
           opposing factions.
05-10-00 : 'consider self' will now show information on visibility and noise.
05-02-00 : Shop owners will now provide value estimates for items that they
           won't buy because they already have too many.
05-02-00 : The social worker will now provide a set of equipment even if
           already have something in inventory.
05-01-00 : 'Write' will now search your inventory if you don't specify
  	   pen/paper.
04-28-00 : Due to the incessant whining about the PLOOT flag, it has been
           disabled.  Apologies for those what actually Did like this flag.
04-16-00 : Re-Imped the color coded shop stuff.  The basic colors are:
           Normal = If can-not-wear
           Green  = Can use regardless.
           BGreen = Can use with restrictions, shield/paired/prim-only
04-16-00 : For those thieves trained in the arts it is now possible to use
           'cudgel'/'stab'/'backstab' in shops for listing purposes.
04-14-00 : When connecting during the boot process the mud will now let you
           know What process it's currently in, instead of just dumping .'s
           then the next process message.
04-14-00 : Upon Login the game will now tell you if new NEWS exists and will
           print the initial line of it also.  This should help some of you
           speed demons keep up with any changes.  It is also active to work
           on 'help nextversion'.
04-12-00 : Many of the master thieves of The World have come together to
           address the problems of disguise.  Through observation and
           patience they have mastered many new disguises for one to wear.
           In combination to this they have readdressed the original methods
           used and have made them more efficient.  Unfortunately some disputes
           among the various thieves have led to a number of racial specific
           disguises.  SEE HELP DISGUISE
04-11-00 : When you steal an object or loot another players corpse you will
           get a flag similar to the PK flag.  This is a silent flag,
           doesn't shout to the room your deeds, but has many of the
           restrictions put on it that the PK flag does.  Beware.
04-11-00 : Due to the need for a fast cudgel reaction, the master thieves
           of The World have started looking into proper off-hand methods
           of doing this.  While the result is not perfect it is usable.
04-09-00 : Killing mobs whom have objects will now assign you as the owner.
04-09-00 : You can now use: stop <player>  to make another player stop
           following you.  You can not be performing a task while trying
           this or you will nuke the task instead.
04-08-00 : Added backwards compatibility for the old "self"/"me" style.
           Both ways are now supported.
04-04-00 : Fixed up the "self"/"me"/check" modifications.  There was a few
           problems in it's logic, as some of you noticed.  Should work as
           intended now.
04-01-00 : Made another change to Summon.  There is now a block in place to
           prevent summoning of ticked off mobs or aggressive mobs to GH.
04-01-00 : Fixed "self"/"me" to properly be replaced with the users name.
           Also added "tank".  Will be replaced with your tanks name if you
           are casting or are engaged and doing something else.  These words
           are now case-sensitive, meaning "TANK" won't work, and must be
           typed in full.  Basic Syntax:
             case heal tank
03-30-00 : Cleric Summon will now be more difficult VS unique and rare mobs.
           To clarify this change this only affects rare/unique mobs.  So
           any problem you might be suffering from general mobs is most likely
           Not due to this change.  I have tested it and I've had some clerics
           test it and it Does work.
03-26-00 : A number of bug reports have been addressed.
03-21-00 : You can now use: attr reset  to reset session stats.
03-21-00 : Those characters with a good perception will now take note of
           doors and such upon entering a room, automatically.  Bold colors
           denote open exits, non-bold denote closed.
03-19-00 : Massive changes to stab have been made.
           1. Stab is now limb based, and so is the damage.
           2. Stab can now be used on ghosts.       
           3. Stab now has special code to handle poison weaps.
02-16-00 : Made some changes to help reduce machine lag.  Also, machine lag
  is calculated differently now, hopefully with more accuracy.
02-03-00 : Skill difficulty is largely disabled now.  Essentially, everything 
  is now regarded as "easy difficulty".  This ought to impact success rates and
  damage from skills accordingly.
02-01-00 : Due to the high amount of vagrants loitering about, shopkeepers 
  and innkeepers are no longer tolerating loiterer.
01-28-00 : Immunities should now provide both an outright chance to avoid
  the effects (as before), as well as a percentage reduction in whatever
  effects are applied.
01-27-00 : Combat crits that result in extra damage will count as crit-kills
  if they are fatal.
01-24-00 : Support for "look in all.corpse" and "get all all.corpse" added.
01-23-00 : Faerie fire changed so that duration is constant, but effect
  depends on level of caster.
01-21-00 : New medical procedure at hospital!  Blindness can be cured.
01-21-00 : Amazingly, this new breakthrough also decreased the duration
  that blindness will persist.
01-21-00 : It appears that trapping was making multiple skill checks
  which made it drastically harder to succeed at making a trap than was
  intended.
01-21-00 : Enhanced identify/divination of creatures to include affecting
  spells, etc.
01-21-00 : Cleaned up some of the messy definition of followers.  Hopefully
  this cleans up some of the problems reported with order not working.
  See HELP FOLLOWERS if you haven't read it lately.
01-20-00 : Yet more time related problems corrected.  It appears that the
  mud clock was not being advanced at the appropriate time (regen was
  happening, just the clock wasn't moving forward).  Also, some internal
  stuff got changed around related to the duration skills last.  Nothing
  should have changed from this latter conversion, but hey, ya never know.
  If skills don't match what the help files say (or seem overly long), bug
  them please.
01-20-00 : Set trap broken into 4 separate skills, one for each trap variety.
  There is little real functional change in the skill, although it is now
  more obvious how much training you have in setting each variety of trap.
01-20-00 : Toned internal speed down a notch.
01-19-00 : Fixed problem introduced re: bold colors.
01-19-00 : By popular request, we are going back to the shortened ticks
  (1 tick is about 36 seconds).  However, there are now 4 ticks per mud
  hour (1 tick is 15 mud minutes long).  If you notice anything weird
  concerning time, let me know.
01-19-00 : Fixed a problem related to polymorphs saving improperly.
01-18-00 : Mounts should stop dying from natural causes when rented now.
  However, mounts that were in rent previously may still die.
01-18-00 : Mobs should wait a minute or so before grabbing a mount just
  vacated by a player.
01-17-00 : NEW INFO RELATED TO RECENT "TIME" CHANGE: 
  It also appears that this makes skills "appear" to report taking more seconds
  to perform.  The number of rounds required has not been changed, although
  the number of "seconds" this translates into has.  No real change other
  than how many seconds are reported has occurred.

  I previously decided to be nice and speed up the interval between ticks
  (for regen).  Unfortunately, when mud-time was accurately calculated,
  faster ticks resulted in more mud years having passed.  We didn't notice
  this problem before because each reboot would cause the mud-time to "slide
  backwards".  I've put the ticks back on a 72 second timer for the time
  being which should fix people's aging problems.
01-17-00 : Fixed problem with mobs tending to wander north and east a lot.
01-14-00 : Disabled the "news changes", reworked the "news" display and
  combined the two concepts.
01-12-00 : An internal value used to correlate mud-time to real-time has
  been corrected.  This should have the effect of speeding everything up
  (combat, regen, ticks, etc).  Feedback welcome.
01-12-00 : Forage can now be done more often.
01-12-00 : Added "news changes" command.  See HELP NEWS.
01-12-00 : Sharpener sped up.
01-12-00 : Wandering mobs slowed down a bit.
01-10-00 : Lay hands and smite have had adjustments made on the learn-by-doing.
  LBD will start later and go up more each successful learn now.
01-10-00 : Still more tweaking on the wander-speed code.
01-10-00 : Fixed chi to not cause lockout when it is not performed.
01-10-00 : Corrected problem of mobs bunching up due to wandering into
  "problem areas" more often.
01-09-00 : More tweaking on the wander-speed code.
01-07-00 : Streamlined some of the mob wander code speeding it up somewhat
  to help get those "stuck" mobs out of peaceful rooms.
01-06-00 : Failed polymorph takes less time to reset now.
01-06-00 : Identify/Divinate on beings will show some additional info.
01-06-00 : You can point in directions now.
01-05-00 : You will now receive a small discount when renting with an
  innkeeper of the same faction, if not unaffiliated.
01-04-00 : Current stats were not being properly altered for +age effects.
  This has been fixed.
01-03-00 : For users of the SneezyMUD client.  A potential problem was
  uncovered in which if you swapped characters without fully dropping
  link, some variables from the first character might migrate to the second.
  We have definitely noticed that quests can move in this fashion.  The problem
  should no longer occur, although, if it has happened to character(s) in your
  account previously, please report it so we can fix you up properly.
01-01-00 : Happy New Year!

    ========================= HAPPY YEAR 2000 ============================
       
12-25-99 : Evaluate has been updated once again.  When evaluating weapons
           and armor it will now give a readout appropriate for you based
           on your class and level, anotherwards it'll tell you how good
           it is for You and not just in general.  Be forewarned that it
           only looks at ac/damage so even if something is Perfect for
           you under evaulate it could still cost more than normal in rent.
12-21-99 : Caught, and corrected, a problem with multiclass practices that
           had them being awarded the single-class number of practices per
           gain per class under certain situations.
12-19-99 : Work has gone into the Noc/Diu bug.  As of this entry testing
           showed that it has been eliminated.  Enjoy.
12-17-99 : The ICQ active list seems to have gone belly up.  I've got a
           call into icq tech support, but looks like trying to run an app
           versioned v0.5beta was a bad idea.
12-17-99 : Can now use wimpy max to set your wimpy to the highest possible.
12-15-99 : Entering portals created by other players in your account is
           now bad for your health.
12-15-99 : Item damage rates decreased further. (less chance of damage)
12-15-99 : Brief exit display should now show adjacent room status, like
           non-brief does, and should actually show the exits once again.
12-12-99 : For users of icq99b, an active list for the Grimhaven community
           has been set up.  Read MOTD for details.
12-10-99 : Economic tweak designed to fix the repair problem introduced.
           Previously, economy was tweaking repair due to statistics gathered
           about how much people were renting.  The idea was that if too much
           was being rented, repair costs would be raised to drain the money
           and folks wouldn't be able to keep the buff stuff.  The problem was
           that it didn't work very well.  The people using excessive gear
           are not necessarily impacted by repair (and converse too).

           I have lowered the repair costs, and reduced the chance of items
           damaging.  At the same time, I have introduced some wacky new
           code that lets the excessive rent problem be handled via rent.
           YOUR RENT CREDIT HAS NOT CHANGED!
           THE TOTAL VALUE OF YOUR GEAR IS THE SAME!
           However, the excess of your gear beyond your rent credit (formerly
           called daily cost) is now subject to a rent-factor-multiplier.
           That is, if you have 1000 talens of gear, and a credit of 900,
           your equipment cost is 100.  If the multiplier is 1.1, then your
           daily cost is 110 talens (100 * 1.1).  Likewise, if the multiplier
           goes to .9, you only pay 90 per day.

           The multiplier is going to fluxuate based on the feedback loop
           from the economy.  I fully expect it will go up slowly over the
           short run.  It will probably be a few weeks before the economy
           reachieves some semblance of equilibrium.

           Please note that while your actual daily rent costs (assuming
           you are over-rent) will fluxuate based on the modifier, they
           will *NOT* change while you are rented.  If you were told it
           would cost 100/day, you will be charged 100/day no matter what
           occurs to the modifier while rented.  The next time you rent out
           though, your costs will be changed to reflect the current modifier.

           This is, naturally, fairly experimental.  Feedback welcome,
           preferably in the listserv.
 
12-07-99 : Player killing rules are now enforced by code.  Read 'help PK'.
12-03-99 : Value in pet-stores will now show you rent cost.
12-03-99 : Fumble will now initiate combat on success and crit-failure.
12-03-99 : auto-noharm should now prevent you from attacking your pets.
12-03-99 : chi will no longer default to the monk doing the chi attack.
12-03-99 : Wither is now fixed to prevent unlimited use on same mob.
12-03-99 : Arrows and Bows will now show a form of 'size' output in
           evaluate.
11-05-99 : Some changes regarding getting objects with pets.  Meaning this
           loophole is now fixed.
11-03-99 : A number of changes/additions to the chi system.  Don't expect
           it to work/act like it did before.
11-01-99 : Mage Belts and any other wearable containers will now display
           their current condition.
10-28-99 : If the use of a skill or spell kills the mob, you will not
           experience the full lag you would in combat.  This code will
	   just wrap up fights and allow you to loot and move on.  No
	   guarantees that this new code catchs every skill but less
	   irrelevant lag is always good for players.
10-25-99 : Reply command now works correctly
10-16-99 : Non-Mages now risk losing the power of invisibility when invoking
           the visible command, be warned.
10-15-99 : Modest increase in damage for the spells needing special
           weather conditions to succeed.
10-13-99 : All non-enhanceable weapons are now considered magic weapons
           for combat purposes.  The mud still does have mobs that are 
	   immune to weapons without specific amounts of hitroll but 
	   generically immune mobs are now hitable by any magic weapon.
	   This mostly addresses Deikhan quest issues where you could
	   not enhance an avenger nor could the avenger hit an immune mob.
10-13-99 : Small adjustment to economy intended to manipulate how much
           money comes from selling equipment, versus how much money comes
           from raw-cash on creatures.  This change should have no impact
           on how much money you make, simply changes what the source of the 
           money will be.  The initial values set in this self-adjusting
           tweak ought to result in lower eq loads (sorry), but greater
           cash (commodities and components too) available on mobs.
10-11-99 : Shopkeepers can no longer contract diseases nor can they be
           stolen from.
10-08-99 : Slight increase in damage for spells that only work outdoors.
10-07-99 : Fixed problem where some affects were inappropriately saying they
           were renewable.
10-07-99 : The dump's money reward now factors in global economy factors.
10-04-99 : Made the 'pile of talen' loads take the overall economic modifiers
           into account.  Since it was pointed out that this loophole was
           largely responsible for letting a handful of people skew the
           economy numbers, I've simultaneously boosted those numbers so that
           the short-term effects of this change won't be horrendous.
09-30-99 : Economic code has changed slightly.  The item damage rate
           (how likely an item will damage per hit) is now fixed, but the
           cost to repair will fluxuate.  Formerly, the reverse was true.
09-30-99 : Paralyze Limb has been fixed and will no longer allow for
           unlimited use on a single mob.
09-28-99 : New who option: -y
           Will display all people not grouped in some way.
09-27-99 : Quest command will once again work as intended.
09-26-99 : Fountains will now work as viable water sources for conjuring
           water elementals.
09-23-99 : Crash bug in ensorcer and some object spells fixed.
09-21-99 : As a temporary fix, talen loads not flutcuating at all till
           we get a handle on why they dropped so low and code a good 
	   solution. Thank you for your patience. We know there has been a
	   problem and this will at least fix it in the short term.
09-15-99 : Conjuring elementals now requires some of the appropriate element
           to be in the room.
09-14-99 : Fixed another crash bug in npc grouping.
09-12-99 : Fixed Crash Bug in polymorph spell.
09-12-99 : Removed the volume penalty for having held items.
09-05-99 : Mud may have some untested client code, please report any
           problems that you observe.
09-05-99 : Rent file deletion based on inactivity turned off.
08-10-99 : Reply now works regardless of visibility
08-10-99 : Astral, Portal, and Summon now work strictly via magic (no
           visibility requirements.)
08-07-99 : Recent studies have found a way to allow a person to switch to
           and from the state of invisiblity at will.  See HELP INVISIBILITY.
08-04-99 : Stab problem fixed.
07-30-99 : Barkskin fixed to use component.
07-30-99 : Repealed the components in spellbags will be weightless/volumeless
           law.  There was no reason to upgrade from small bags to larger
           ones.  Instead, components weight and volume will be significantly
           reduced when in a spellbag.
07-30-99 : Only the primary rider of a mount will be allowed to give the
           mount orders now.
07-28-99 : The -f flag to who will now list members of your faction.
07-27-99 : Modified the faction command 'send' to work as a global channel
           for factions (one for each faction).  It uses moves and lags 
           like shout.  Faction caravans have been disabled, as they have
           not been fully tested.  Faction leaders can now be assigned,
           and tithing should be fully functional.  I'm not going to promise
           I'll do anymore faction coding, but I thought this would be an ok
           start. (Peel)
07-26-99 : Made elementals have unique "corpses"
07-26-99 : Made retreat skill give chance to stay on mount during flee
07-26-99 : Fixed a problem with how equipment on followers was being rented.
07-22-99 : Repaired fear spell to be more long-lasting.
07-21-99 : Farlook will no longer do a double take nor will it cause us
           to lockup.
07-21-99 : God check in stave charge re-disabled.  Not sure what happened
           but apologies.
07-21-99 : The various quest mobs of The World should now operate even if
           triggered while casting spells and such.
07-20-99 : The High Mages of The World have finally found a way to allow
           fledgling master mages to recharge staffs.  This process is very
           costly and time consuming and is also rumored to only work on
           staffs, not wands.  SEE HELP CHARGE STAVE
07-20-99 : Made a few more races ridable.  Please bug any mobs you find that
           you run across that are obviously not intended to be ridden.
07-19-99 : Overhauled the Vindicator quest.  The quest itself is essentially
           unchanged, however, the logic used is much cleaner and there
           will hopefully be fewer problems with this quest.
           Conversion problems should be directed to Batopr.
07-18-99 : Materialize/Spon-Generation are once again useable.  Sorry for
           the downtown on them.
07-16-99 : Horse breeders of The World switched there oats to keep horses
           from attacking lower level mounters.
07-16-99 : Seeing a need for it the greater Deikhans of The World have
           found a way to coax flying mounts to land with a greater
           understanding of ride winged.
07-14-99 : News item a few days ago about pets being put on pc scale
           was erroneous.  Only the conjured elementals code was activated.
           This has been fixed so know that bought pets will have
           different characteristics than they did yesterday.  In general,
           they should have less hp and do more damage.  Be careful in
           your initial fights till you see how the changes affect them.
           This will only apply to new pets and not old ones.
07-14-99 : New command retrain <petname>.  This command will let you
           re-acquire your pets after death. It will only apply to
           bought pets. As with most new commands, please make us
           aware of any problems with it as soon as possible.
           This semi permanence is going to have some offsets which
           are still in coding, including pet death and pet training.
07-14-99 : Not only should farlook work now but it should also Not put
           everyone into brief mode anymore.
07-13-99 : Two components for a non-existant spell have been retired.
           If you happened to own either the soul of a lost pet, or the
           rabbit's foot on a chain, it will be morphed into a rapidly
           decaying hairball in order to extract itself safely.
07-13-99 : Fixed a problem that was causing quest mobs to load other mobs
           instead of their quest objects.
07-12-99 : Start of change to pets/elementals.  This change will make
           put elementals, charmees and pets on pc damage and hitpoint scales.
           Thus having a pet should be more equivalent to having a groupmate
           of that level.  This may make some pets better and some worse.
           It should lower the hp and raise the damage of most enthralls.
           This will not affect already purchased pets, only new purchases.
07-09-99 : A number of unimplemented skills/spells/prayers have been
           concealed from view.
07-08-99 : The problem where certain effects were not disappearing properly
           should hopefully be fixed.
07-07-99 : Due to powerleveling abuse, an arbitrary cap has been introduced
           into the defense calculations.  The net effect is that excess AC
           beyond a reasonably high ceiling will be ignored.  This is 
           primarily addressed at newbie chars wearing high level armor, and
           should have little or no impact on more typical players.
07-07-99 : Invisibility fixed so can be renewed.
07-07-99 : No-flee rooms will bypass wimpy check now.
07-01-99 : When someone or something now follows you it will be placed at
           the end of the list instead of the head of it.
06-24-99 : Elementals and Pet death/return re-enabled.
06-23-99 : Doctor dieing problem fixed/elemental dieing naturally disabled.
           Crash bug in pray <no argument> fixed.
06-21-99 : You can now order your elementals to return to their planes.
           Syntax is exact "order elemental/follower return".
           You can also release your pets.  They will die and leave corpses
           around the mud as well.  Problem that was preventing old elementals
           and pets from disappearing fixed. Expect some other changes to
           pets and elementals and of course we will have some bugs and
           imbalances as code comes in so if you see something that is
           either too restricting or doesn't seem right, it may not be and
           feel free to bug it. 
06-19-99 : Reworked the dragon breath damage formulas to better reflect
           damage in today's combat.
06-18-99 : NPC's that fight your mob-follower (pets, charms, thralls,
           elementals) will only develop a hatred toward the master if the
           mob-follower is the aggressor or if the master is also fighting
           the mob.  If a mob aggros your mob-follower it should not hate you
           if you don't fight it.
06-17-99 : Removed magic-item (scroll, potion, wand, staff) failure due to
           skill failure.  Obviously, these items will still fail if the
           conditions for the spell/prayer aren't right.  This feature may
           reappear when player-created magic-items (brew, scribe, etc) are
           a reality, but until then...
06-17-99 : Fixed a problem in how mob's hitroll was treated when calculating
           the mob's level, and by extension its XP.  In essence, Hitroll was
           being figured much higher then it was supposed to be (for level
           determination, not for combat).  The correction should have
           adjusted some mobs downward in level (and XP).
06-16-99 : Fixed a problem that was causing elementals to become super
           powerful because of recent changes.
06-16-99 : Made some significant underlying infrastructure changes to how
           mob AC, Dam and HP work, primarily to simplify building.  We
           don't believe you should notice any changes, although some minor
           fluxuation may have occurred.  Be warned though that some grossly
           unbalanced mobs may have been cleaned up by this process as well.
06-16-99 : Certain combat considerations (chance of hitting, etc) for L51+
           mobs have changed.  Basically, L51+ is now on the same scale as
           L1-L50.
06-16-99 : Mob's level scale now only extends up to L70, except for utility
           mobs (guildmasters, trainers) which may still be (technically)
           L100.  This upper limit is thought to provide adequate challenge
           for a *LARGE* group of high level players given the above combat
           system change.  Old L51+ mobs are scaled into the new L51-L70
           levels.
           It's thought that changing the level and the combat system in the
           same basic way will result in little observable change from a
           player's perspective.  Use some caution however.
06-16-99 : Fixed problem with cure disease not curing certain diseases.
06-15-99 : Fixed cure disease invoked via objects to work.
06-15-99 : Made Read Magic an available skill pending availability of the
           quest to learn it that way.
06-15-99 : Made enhance weapon learn naturally to higher value before the
           learn-by-doing stuff kicks in.
06-12-99 : You can now use 'list paired' to display objects that are paired.
           This is mainly used with pants(over leggings) and two-handed
           weapons.
06-08-99 : Fixed a problem with cure poison invoked via objects.
06-04-99 : World related changes and additions will now be told by the
           Town Crier instead of being placed in this NEWS file.
06-03-99 : In answer to requests, old elementals will now return to
           their planes when no longer pets.
06-03-99 : Air elementals made less powerful to balance against their fly.
           In addition, slight change to randomness formula in elemental
           generation so that you can no longer have elementals over your
           level.
06-02-99 : Lay hands modified.  Failures will prevent reattempt for an hour.
           Success is still a 12 hour things though.
06-02-99 : Faerie fire duration decreased.
06-01-99 : A rare disease has found its way into several of the horse
           stables about the realm.  The leaders of the various cities
           have demanded all remaining stock is to be reserved for the
           calvary's needs until such a time the numbers can be 
           replenished. The various animal marketers about the realm are
           in an uproar, but are powerless to fight back.
06-01-99 : The King has announced the opening of the Faction Mansion, 
           a place where faction leaders can meet in peace.
           Thanks to Syl for overseering his followers in building
           this new addition.
05-31-99 : A few recent storms seem to have thinned out the forest along
           the path between Grimhaven and the Arena.  Various explorers
           have reported some sparse forest off the path to the east
           where they encounted some workers harvesting fruits.
           Thanks to Coral and her followers for exploring and mapping
           this new found forest.
05-30-99 : Fixed a bug that was allowing animals with certain body types to
           wear inappropriate armor.
05-30-99 : Rent offer note output for components will be compresed now.
           Also a few changes to make it look pretty.  A note on the comp
           output.  The trailer is: [COST_PERxTOTAL_COUNT]
05-29-99 : A bug that was allowing many of you mages to cast from the
           waiste before your time was fixed.  You will have to wait until
           your wizardry says you can before you can do it again.
05-29-99 : The various wood workers of The World have finally decided to
           open there trade skills to the various adventurers and have
           begun teaching the basics of whittling.
05-26-99 : Tweaked accelerate/haste's effect on command lock-out.
05-26-99 : Increased duration of feathery descent.
05-24-99 : Supple and Wide Leather Armor sets for human monks underwent
           some changes.  For the most part it was made better to fit
           the level of PC it was originally intended for.
05-24-99 : Playing with a few lower weapons to achieve a couple of things:
           1) Make the hierarchy a little more apparent
           2) Make room and add some additional lower level weapons
           This will mainly be adjusting names and adding new weapons,
           hopefully any actual adjustments to the weapons will be avoided.
           So if you suddenly have a "different" weapon its most likely
           just a name change.
05-23-99 : Can now use 'prompt bar' to toggle the vt100/ansi information bar
           on and off.
05-23-99 : BLoad will now work if your wielding the bow your trying to load.
05-22-99 : Drink containers are not as compressable as they formerly were.
05-22-99 : You can now use the term-none prompt in vt100 and ansi modes.
           *** This does not work for the client.
05-21-99 : After many delays (good contracters are so hard to find),
	   Adder's Coffee House has officially opened for business in
	   Grimhaven at the corner of Park Avenue and Perimeter Road.
           The Snake Pit bar, a rather rough hangout, has also opened in
	   the basement of the same building.  As these are new
	   establishments, the crowds at the moment are rather light, but
	   business is expected to pick up.  Both establishments have both
	   public rooms, where one can socialize with the masses, and
	   private rooms for use with your closest friends.
05-21-99 : Many skills/spells/prayers have had their damages raised.
           The rational for this is that if they had a "save" that cut damage
           in half, the typical damage should account for the chance of the
           save occuring.  The result is about a 33% increase in the damage of
           most mage spells, and many cleric and deikhan prayers.
05-21-99 : Fixed up "list fit" in component shops to work for rangers.
05-19-99 : Raised max exists slightly, but lowered load rates to
           compensate.  What this means is more people can get the
           limited items, but it will take additional work to do so.
           It was only a slight bump for now, will be watching and 
           adjusting on an upward swing for a bit til a good balance
           is found.
05-19-99 : Due to complaints, more changes to the way the board posts.
           It's back the way it was before, newest message will have highest
           number and, by default, will list all messages incrementally.  You
           can also do "look board reverse" to see the messages in reverse
           numerical order (last posted, first listed).
05-17-99 : Charge skill should be fixed.  If problems remain, please
           bug it again.
05-17-99 : Mysterious reports of a new visitor to the woodelven druids.  
05-14-99 : Various fixes for spellbag weight/volume problems.
05-14-99 : Undead made disease resistant.
05-14-99 : Springleap will increase more per successful-learning now.
05-13-99 : Springleap changed so that it can't be used to initiate combat.
05-12-99 : More tweaks to affect availability of holy water.
05-12-99 : Spellbags will no longer increase in weight or volume for the
           components put into them.
05-12-99 : Put in better starting values for the item-damage rates in the
           economy.  Should speed up the self-correction time somewhat.
05-12-99 : Yet more tweaks to the fleeing problem.
05-12-99 : Sharpening price reduced dramatically.
05-12-99 : Fixed problem of gills of flesh not being stackable.
05-12-99 : Fixed damage formula for NPCs wielding a weapon.
05-12-99 : Fixed mobs that were fleeing for no apparent reason.
05-11-99 : Change to increase the availability of holy water introduced.
05-11-99 : Problem of L50 not having access to factions fixed.
05-11-99 : Expectations about how repair fits into overall economy revised.
           Previously, the mud was trying to pull too much money out of the
           game via repair (hence damage rates were too high).  Hopefully,
           the new setup will push the equilibrium toward a more acceptable
           rate of item damage.
05-10-99 : Fixed flee problem.  It appears mobs that were afraid of a certain
           person would flee from EVERYONE.
05-09-99 : Fixed bug in shooting.
05-09-99 : Fixed rate of item damage (the self-correcting rate initialized
           much higher than what we were using in beta).
05-08-99 : Public opening of v5.1

------------- END OF BETA TEST

05-08-99 : Slight change in limit bank will agree to let you deposit.  It has
           been increased over L20.
05-08-99 : Experience under score, prompt and the levels command will now
           have commas.
05-08-99 : Limb prayer afflictions are back to their former success rates.
           They still require you to pick one and only one of them, but
           you can continue to try and invoke until it succeeds.  They
           have a greater tendency to target certain limbs over other ones
           now however.
05-07-99 : Metabolism rates globally reduced to lessen need for food & drink.
05-07-99 : Minor fix in the mob flee logic to prevent flee/return/flee/return
           sillyness.
05-07-99 : Alteration in the trimming of damage for spells/prayers cast on
           higher level critters.  Should be less severe for high level vs
           high level now.
05-07-99 : Change to numb, wither, paralyze limb, and bone breaker.  You
           may only invoke one of these on any given mob once (If it fails,
           thats it).  The success rates for them have been decreased as
           well, BUT a sizable portion of failures will result in what can
           best be described as an anti-salve.  Refinement is expected,
           feedback and constructive criticism welcome.
05-07-99 : Partially used fuel will have reduced volume/weight.
05-07-99 : Due to volume concerns, an ounce of holy water now goes twice
           as far in terms of attuning, but the price has been increased
           accordingly.
05-06-99 : Treasurys and vaults changed to load over longer duration and
           replenish.  Now stop asking for reboots all the time  :)
05-06-99 : Self-attuning speed fixed.
05-06-99 : Piety increase for failed penancing raised slightly.
05-05-99 : Janitors will dispose of corpses they collect.  They will still
           donate the contents of corpses though.
05-05-99 : Changed mob wealth formula to achieve desired amount of gold.
05-05-99 : Swapped out rent files (again) due to weapon change.
05-04-99 : Fixed item damage problem that was evident in PC vs NPC cases.
05-04-99 : Replaced underlying way weapon damage was implemented.
           Theoretically, you shouldn't notice a whole lot of difference,
           but the old XdY system is gone, replaced by a more simple
           "damage level" and "damage deviation".  The first simply defines
           the average damage the weapon does, and the second is used to find
           how much randomness is involved.  This is a lot easier to
           maintain and setup for the implementors.
05-04-99 : Fixed problems with skills that reported kills when a kill didn't
           actually happen.
05-03-99 : The relative load rates for components of utility spells (compared
           to components of offensive spells) lowered.  This should mean
           a greater majority of the components are for offensive spells.
05-03-99 : The doctors of The World will now withdraw from your bank account
           if you do not have enough on-hand to cover your doctor expenses.
05-03-99 : It is possible to evaluate your room to obtain basic information.
           This can be especially useful to rangers in finding nature rooms.
           SEE HELP EVALUATE
05-03-99 : It is now possible charge multiple rooms towards your target.
           SEE HELP CHARGE
05-03-99 : Compare can now be used by mortals, sorry about that.
05-03-99 : Arrow price dropped.
05-03-99 : Rentfiles recopied from v5.0 baseline.  They will undergo upgrade
           to v5.1 stats again.  Also, components and symbols will be upgraded
           (previously they were excepted) but as a result, 0-cost or
           personalized comps/symbs will be made generic, full-cost variety.
           Sorry. 
05-03-99 : Fix for symbol stress put in.
05-03-99 : Problem with mob wealth fixed.
05-03-99 : Start of Beta test period.
05-03-99 : Under pressure from Citadel merchants Bishop Mercess and
           Sorceror Valteez have reluctantly decreed the Obsidian Citadel
           safe and reopened its main gates for trade.  Unfortunately
           during the years of isolation its main trade route has become
           hazardous and may take some time to become safely passable.
           Thanks to Mithros for this new area.
05-02-99 : You can now compare two objects for basic information.  Compare
           relies on your evaluate skill to determine what is shown.
05-01-99 : Modifications made to item damaging.  The intent was to better
           item damage and repair with the rest of the economy.  It may
           take a few days for the system to self-correct though.
05-01-99 : Factions made accessible.  You will need to level once to kick
           things into action, and then just follow the obvious directions.
           Factions are almost strictly for roleplay at this point, and the
           current setup is EXTREMELY limited in scope.  More enhancements
           to come depending on how the reaction to factions go.
05-01-99 : Maximum number of components in a shop raised.
05-01-99 : Slight modification to component pricing to make hard-to-find
           components sell for more (although rent should remain low).
04-29-99 : While on routine poacher raids north of Grimhaven, the local
           guards have reported discovering several badly mauled bodies.
           From the appearance of the wounds, the aggressors are large 
           flesh eating bears.  Although the victims are primarily poachers,
           there have been a number of local farmers and hunters as well as 
           bodies belonging to a previously unknown race of dark skinned 
           dwarves, thought to dwell underground.  Local authorities urge 
           caution near any caves or underground entrances near the poacher 
           hunting grounds.  Thanks to Peel for this area.
04-27-99 : Damage on deikhan quest weapons modified.
04-27-99 : Overhauled how saving throws were being handled.  The old method
           was based on a lot of outdated systems and the net effect was
           a high level always saved while a newbie always failed.
04-27-99 : Due to the variety and nature of the changes in various pieces of
           equipment, items stored in rent have reverted to the new
           variant.  While this means that damage is repaired free of
           charge, you will most likely lose any enhancements or enchantments
           of a magical nature too.  Where noted in the below news, prices
           and rent costs will also be affected.
04-27-99 : Evaluate symbol now works, and reveals an approximation of how many
           ounces of holy water are required to attune a symbol.
04-27-99 : Holy water pricing formulas changed to reflect changes in
           holy symbols.
04-23-99 : Fixed apparant bug that gave grouped mounts a share when you
           dismounted from them to loot talens.  Fix means no mobs can
           get shares. If this is undesirable for some reason, please
           bug it.
04-23-99 : Tweaks made to make evaluate a bit more useful.
04-23-99 : Pet, charm, thralls are now limited both by total number involved,
           as well as by overall power of all pets.
04-23-99 : Due to complaints about the message removal policy, messages on
           the board will now post in the reverse order (latest message is
           #1).  Previously we were removing messages to keep the board to
           about one page worth, so posting like this means we won't have to
           scroll to see new messages and eliminates need to remove messages.
04-22-99 : Tasked spells, because they do damage at the end rather than
           lagging after the fact, are doing slightly more damage now.
04-22-99 : BLoad will now check for quivers and take from them as well.
04-19-99 : Wholesale changes to symbols performed related to symbol strength
           and prayer stress.  The previous system was reasonably good, but
           was largely unpredictable in terms of results of odd situations.
           Under new system, a given prayer will cause a fixed amount of
           stress, but the way symbols are constructed, a low-level prayer's
           stress is a drop in the bucket as compared to a high-level
           symbol's total strength.
           New pricing formulas are in place for symbols, and there is an
           allowance for symbols when calculating clerics rent credit as well.
04-16-99 : Performed largescale overhaul of equipment.  Previously,
           a number of assumptions about how much +tohit (thac0) a person
           should have were being made, and various formulas were adjusting
           for these assumptions.  Since this just complicated things, most
           +tohit effects have been removed, and formulas have been corrected
           so that possessing a certain +tohit is not mandatory.
04-16-99 : Fixed problem in combat related to how many swings creatures get
           per round.  It was essentially rounding fractional attacks up to
           the next highest attack, thus a creature that was supposed to have
           2.1 attacks per round would get 3.
04-14-99 : Rent credit has been boosted.  Rent credit was previously based
           on just covering equipment's AC and structure cost, leaving
           sundries, magic and weapon's cost to be covered by the player.
           We will now be moving to a rent credit should cover the cost
           of ALL appropriate gear, in the hope that it will make truly
           renting cost-free possible.  
           Unfortunately, because rent credit now tries to sum up the price
           of a wide variety of gear, it no longer follows a nice neat curve. 
           For the most part, what it awards is what it should be, and you'll
           have to create your own rules of thumb about how much extra you get
           per level (class-based).
04-14-99 : Pricing formula for weapons has been reworked.
04-14-99 : Can now use 'group amtank/amnottank' to decide if you do/don't
           want to try and block switches during combat.
04-09-99 : Rate of crit-success/crit-fails from skills, spells and prayers
           reduced.  Spell backfire was occuring way too much.
04-09-99 : Natural stats (chosen + racial + terrain) are now revealed to
           all players via the "attribute condition" command.
04-09-99 : Fixed problem with mobs having wrong immunities/susceptabilities.
           Only natural imm/susc were being applied, and those set by the
           builder were being lost.
04-09-99 : Attuners sped up.
04-07-99 : Ideas submitted will all be sent to the listserv for discussion.
04-05-99 : Limb health increase that mobs received in late v5.0 given to
           PCs as well.
03-26-99 : A cross-the-board increase in limb health has gone into effect. 
03-25-99 : Double class characters can now be created if you have obtained
           a L50 single class.  Triple class characters can now be created
           if you obtain a L50 double class.
03-25-99 : Multiplay rules relaxed somewhat.  See HELP MULTIPLAY.
03-25-99 : Free Deaths awarded during previous version have been removed.
03-24-99 : Improved realism for "stun" from doorbash and cudgel.
ongoing  : Skills, Spells and Prayers that have had their effects tweaked to
           address the "balance" concepts developed during v5.0:
              bash, blur, bodyslam, chivalry, immobilize, oomlat

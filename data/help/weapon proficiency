Each of the four weapon styles (blunt, pierce, slash and ranged) may be 
practiced in order to improve your skill in that style attack.  An unproficient
person has a good chance of making an error when he uses that type weapon.  
Errors such as hitting yourself, hitting the wrong target, or just missing 
all together are common when you aren't proficient.  By contrast, the
expert has a better chance of hitting, and is also able to direct his shots
toward more "critical" spots.  Critical blows do upwards of twice the normal
damage as a regular blow would.   Any fool can use a weapon, but it takes
training and practice to wield a weapon well and not be more of a danger to 
yourself than your target.

Syntax: rest {object}

Rest causes you to stretch yourself out as if you were sleeping but
remain conscious.  While resting, you will receive the benefit of an
increased regeneration rate for the duration of the period that you
are resting.

Various objects can be rested on.  These objects will increase your
regeneration even further as they provide a comfortable place to rest.
Obviously, the object must be big enough to rest on, as you can't stretch
out and get comfortable on just anything.  Also, objects designed for
small creatures may prove to be a bit too uncomfortable to provide any
benefit.

To stop resting, merely stand up or change to some other position.

<R>WARNING:<z> Resting can be detrimental to the lifeforce of a Shaman.

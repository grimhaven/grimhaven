Syntax: extinguish <light source | me> {room | held}

The extinguish command is used to put out a light source or fire.  The object
must either be equipped or in the room.  If the first argument is 'me' rather
than an object, the player will attempt to put out any equipped items that are
burning.

The optional second argument is used to distinguish between objects in the room
and those equipped by the player.  If not specified, the command will look for
an object in the room first.

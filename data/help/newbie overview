NEWBIE OVERVIEW:

Since <h> was started in 1992, it has gone through massive changes and
complete rewrites, and it's in many ways very different from other muds
out there. Because of that, it's important you take some time to get set
up and get familiar with The World of <h>.

Note that a tutorial very similar to this has been written, drawn, voice
reorded and submitted to Youtube.  Presenting the SneezyMUD visual new 
users guide:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukslQWRMTU

Also, Aunt Dee above the inn is our tutorial NPC who will go over the same
topics, but in an interactive fashion, giving you tasks to complete and 
rewards for comppleting them.

Continue reading for a condensed quickie summary!

<c>Getting set up<1>
<c>1.<1> Set your toggles properly. Read HELP TOGGLE for an extensive
list of options and parameters. To see your current set up, type
TOGGLE. Make sure your terminal type is correct, read HELP TERMINAL.

<c>2.<1> Colorize it! Colors are a good way to bring your attention to
important things. You can color diferent categories and substitute hard
to see colors with ones that are easily viewed. Read HELP COLOR for more.

<c>Preparing for battle<1>
<c>3.<1> Configure your prompt. Make sure all the relevant information for your
character is there. Read HELP PROMPT for more information and type PROMPT with
no parameters to see your current configuration.

<c>4.<1> WEAR ALL before you pick a fight. You can see what you're wearing
by typing EQUIPMENT and what you're carrying by typing INVENTORY. There's
more info on HELP OBJECT MANIPULATION.

<c>5.<1> Practice before you fight. As is, you are unlearned in the ways of
your class, but you have been given some practices that you can use at your
trainer. You can see a list of disciplines available to your class by typing
PRACTICE, and the skill in each discipline by typing PRACTICE <disciplline>.
When in the presence of an appropriate trainer, use PRACTICE
<discipline> {number} {class} to actually use practice points and learn
things. Read HELP PRACTICE and HELP DISCIPLINE for more information. See
the next topic for help in locating your trainer.

<c>6.<1> Find your bearings. You have been placed in the great city of Grimhaven,
the central city of <h>. To assist you in getting around, read HELP GOTO.
There's valuable information there on how to get to places where you can eat,
drink, practice and fight.

<c>Lets get down to business!<1>
<c>7.<1> Assuming you're dressed up for battle and have used up all your practices,
it's time to spread havoc! CONSIDER mobs before you attack them. It'll give
you some information on your odds at winning that fight. When you think you've
found a good target, HIT or KILL <mob>. If you feel like your life is in danger,
you can always just FLEE. Some mobs will try to track you down and finish off
the fight though, so be careful!

<c>8.<1> If you got badly injured in a fight, seek the hospital for fast healing.
You won't be charged for the doctor services while you're a newbie, so make use
of it! GOTO HOSPITAL will give you directions.

<c>9.<1> Dealing with a death. So you picked a bad fight and ended up dead. You'll
be taken back to the login screen where you should log your character back into
the game. When you died, a corpse was generated in the room you died with all your
belongings in it. When you log back in you'll notice you have no equipment and
possibly only 1 hit point. Get yourself healed (remember the hospital?) and do a
corpse retrieval to collect your stuff. When you've found your corpse, type GET
ALL CORPSE to get your things.

<c>Logging out of the game<1>
<c>10.<1> You need to find an inn and RENT in order to have your character properly
saved for the next time you come back. GOTO INN will give you directions to the
closest inn. Please note that dropping link is not adviseable.  

<c>Getting more help<1>
Virtually every command you can type has a help file associated with it, but
if you feel you need live assistance, please contact a newbie helper. You can
see who these are by typing WHO, they will have the (Newbie-Helper) flag next to
their name.

<c>Final notes<1>
The immortal staff of <h> is actively working in making the mud newbie-friendly,
please feel free to contact the immortal staff if you have any ideas that will
make your stay with us more enjoyable.

Last, you are expected to know the RULES of SneezyMUD, specially the ones regarding
MULTIPLAY and CHARACTER USAGE. Read those help files at some point too!

<c>Have fun!<1>

Staffs (or staves) are large magical sticks akin to wands.  The staff has
been imbued with a magical spell, such that when the staff is invoked, one
charge of the staff is expended as the spell it contains is discharged.

Staffs can contain any number of charges, and hence any number of uses.
Similarly, they are frequently charged with a large variety of spells.
One of the discoveries alchemists have made is that only a certain type
of material and shape is able to hold a given magic, hence it is possible
to determine a staff's spell merely by the shape and form of the staff itself.

The spell that a staff casts is typically more powerful than a wand,
and as such affects everything in the room with the magic.  Offensive
staffs tend to have a safeguard against blowback to the user of the staff
and that person's group.

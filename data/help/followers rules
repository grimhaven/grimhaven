In general, the master of a follower is held accountable for the actions of
the follower.

If you order a follower to attack another player, you'll be held accountable
as if you attempted to PK them yourself.

If you bring an aggro follower into town, and some hapless newbie gets
slaughtered, you will be held accountable.

If your follower has some special ability (thieving, etc), and you relocate
that follower to a place it is not normally found, you may be asked to
make reparations to the unwitting victims of the follower.

Syntax: retrain <NPC name>

Retrain allows an adventurer to re-acquire a pet after the adventurer dies. 
For the most part it only works with purchased pets although there may be
some exceptions for other types of pets. 

The ability to retrain has some limitations. First, it is on a timer. You
will only have a reasonable period of time to reclaim your pet.  In
addition, there is a chance of failing the retrain. If the retraining
fails, the pet will be fully returned to the wild and will no longer be
retrainable.  Last, you can not retrain another adventurers pet for them.

CAVEAT: CRASHED orphan pets will not be reload in mud and are not
reimbursable.  So get back on and get your pets retrained fast.

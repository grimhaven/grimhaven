Mana represents a spell caster's magical inner store of power.  While all
natural creatures have mana of some sort, in most folks it lies dormant.
Anytime a spell is cast, the caster's mana is reduced.  Over time, a spell
caster is able to replenish their mana by drawing on the magical energies
of The World around them.

Certain regions of The World have been isolated from the magical
lifelines that allow spell casters to regenerate mana.  Such regions
will prevent mana from being regenerated.

A few years ago, the Arch-Magi Quazifrene discovered a way to store excess
mana in mildly magical vessels of opal.  These powerstones are highly
sought after by the mages of The World.  If a mage runs out of mana while
casting a spell, the mage's vitality will start being drained by the
spell.

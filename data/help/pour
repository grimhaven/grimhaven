Syntax: pour <container> <other container>
Syntax: pour <container> out

Pour allows you to move a liquid from <container> into <other container>
or <out> to effectively empty <container>.  Obviously you can't fill
a container with more then it can hold.

Mixing liquid types (water and wine for instance) will lead to a yucky,
unpalatable sludge that is better left undrunk.

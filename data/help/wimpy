Syntax : toggle wimpy <argument>

Possible arguments :

toggle wimpy off	: turns your wimpy mode off
toggle wimpy <number> 	: sets your wimpy mode to flee at <number> hit points
toggle wimpy max        : Sets your wimpy value to the maximum allowed value

Wimpy mode causes flees to be attempted should your hit points fall below the
critical <number>.  Any combat damage (starvation, bleeding, drowning, etc is
ignored) incurred will cause a "flee" to be added to your command queue.  This
flee attempt will be executed as soon as you are able to do your next command.
It is NOT an automatic flee as it waits until command-lockout (from being bashed
or from past skill attempts) clears.  Wimpy ONLY kicks in when you are hit
below your wimpy value (ie, if the opponent is missing, you will not flee).

When wimpy kicks in, it will flush any outstanding commands in your input queue.
This will cause all things (leftover kicks, attempts to cast, tells, says, etc)
in the queue to be lost and go unexecuted.  Obviously, if you're about to die,
all actions flushed would be of secondary importance to saving your skin.

Like all flees, wimpy does not guarantee that the flee will succeed.  Also,
wimpy may take you from the frying pan into the fire (you may want to turn
wimpy off if the surrounding regions are dangerous).

You can only set your wimpy value to LESS THAN 1/2 your max hit points.
e.g.   You have 24 hit points.  You can set wimpy to 11.  (12 is half max,
but you must be less than 1/2).  Use the "wimpy max" command if you don't
want to do the math.

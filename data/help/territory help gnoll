As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
by your racial selection.  Territorial selection serves as a modifier
on these natural stats.  So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race
here that will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm. 

Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
game.  However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly
by your choice of background.  The chief effect of territorial
choice is to modify your natural racial stats.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tribal Gnoll: You were raised as a pup in a tightly-knit tribe of gnolls.
You feel comfortable around small to mid-size groups, and have gained some
small amount of education and experience from your upbringing.

Savanna Gnoll: You were raised along the plains and savanna grasses, near
the veldt.  Your early life gave you strength and perception, but you have
neglected focus and education.

Ruins Gnoll: You and your litter inhabited some old ruins or other abandoned
dwellings.  Your education has been minimal, but your upbringing has
made your body tougher and more resilient.

Jungle Gnoll: You come from a small pack of gnolls who hunt and live deep
in the jungle.  The tribe has much less wisdom to impart through education,
but the vigors of jungle life gives your tribe the most fortitude of any
other gnoll packs.

Warf Gnoll: Although less educated than a tribal gnoll, you are a
saavy scavenger.  You are slightly weaker than most gnolls, but
otherwise are well balanced for your preferred habitat of dirty warfs,
garbage dumps and midden heaps.

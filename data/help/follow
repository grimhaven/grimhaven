Syntax: follow <person>
Syntax: follow me

Follow allows you to match the moves of <person> so that anywhere <person>
goes, you will go too.  That is assuming that you are actually able to
follow them there.  ie. lack of vitality, broken limbs, obstacles, etc
will keep you busy while <person> goes merrily off on their way.

To stop following someone, either "follow <your name>" or "follow me"
will work.

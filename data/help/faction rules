The addition of factions requires that certain policies be instituted in order
to maintain a certain degree of sanity.  These rules will be enforced by
gods for the most part.

1.) No person may have characters in separate factions.  It just encourages
sabotage otherwise. 
2.) Characters known to be the mortals of a currently active god are denied
from being members in any faction.  The perception of cheating is just too
great.

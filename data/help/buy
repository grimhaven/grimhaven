Syntax: buy <item>

This command is used in shops to do just what it says: purchase objects.
You can use the LIST command to determine what is available for buying.

A variety of argument can be used with the buy command.

buy sword      : buys the first sword in the shopkeeper's inventory
buy short sword: buys the first short sword in the shopkeeper's inventory
buy 3.dagger   : buys the 3rd dagger in the shopkeeper's inventory
buy 38         : buys the 38th thing in the shopkeeper's inventory
buy 3*dagger   : buys the first 3 daggers in the shopkeeper's inventory,
                 or as many daggers as the shopkeeper has up to a total
                 of three.

Theoretically, you could also do:
buy 3*38   or    buy 3*3.dagger
But, since each time an item is purchased, the numbers in the list are
reshuffled, these will most likely cause you to buy something you did
not intend to.  Consider yourself warned.

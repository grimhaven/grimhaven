  Once the Gnomes Center of Knowledge, gnomish scholars from around the
Realm would gather here to study and advance their learning.  Gnights and
other warriors would also come to study and learn important techniques and
principals.  Unfortunately the Center was destroyed when attacked by the
Lich Lixlor.  Although finally successful in stopping Lixlor, the damage
was done.  The Center had been destroyed, and its inhabitants reduced to
spirits who would eternally wander the Ruins as they made the ultimate
sacrifices to defend their home and beliefs.  Now nothing more then a pile
of Ruins, it is still considered a Gnomish Holy Site where gnome pilgrims
often travel to be reminded not only of the Center's original purpose, but
also about the sacrifices made to defend it.

  A caravan from beyond the Atakaji Desert has arrived at Thraix's arena
north of Grimhaven to sell exotic animals to contest the gladiators.
Rumours say that the caravan is protected by some great being, though what
that being is remains undiscovered.  The caravan leader is a man by the
name of Khalid.  A shrewd trader if there ever was one, talks between him
and Khalid seem to be taking a long time with no sign of a deal anytime
soon.

  The Chaos Plains are a magical blasted lands which sit in the heart of
the Realm of Sorrill.  In ancient times dragons of such power battled for
centuries over these lands, their final battles were so intense that
magics of unimaginable strength were released upon the land.  Now in the
form of the Chaos Winds this magic reeks havoc upon the plains as it
wanders aimlessly.  The Janesee & Sedmar Rivers flow through its heart and
meet where a once fabulous city stood, long ago destroyed by a dragon.  To
the west lies the forbidding Marjiln Mountains where the source of the
Janasee River can be found as well as the fabled Obsidian Citadel.

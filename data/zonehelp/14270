  Found below the ruins of the Gnomish Center of Knowledge these catacombs
while once used to house the honored dead of the Center, now hold the 
undead minions of Lixlor.  Sealed within the catacombs, Lixlor continually
battles for his escape.  It is said access to the catacombs can only be
achieved through the intervention of the spirits Gnora and Gniles, as they
were the architects of the catacombs magical seal.

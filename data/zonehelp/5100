  A true marvel, this complex system of sewer pipes lies below the fair
city of Grimhaven.  While most are maintained by the Grimhaven Sewer workers
and patrolled by Sewer guards, there are still several neglected areas
where the unfriendly lurk.  Rumors abound about a small sect of were-rats
and the sewer workers to this day refuse to go near the pipes beneath
the Grimhaven Cathedral.   Many a young adventurer has began their rise
to power by gaining experience and knowledge helping to keep the city's
darker elements in check below the city streets.

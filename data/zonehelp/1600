The political strife in the village of Lionheart has strained the resources
that would normally patrol these roads.  They are somewhat dangerous, and
falling into disrepair.  Nevertheless, Norman's Road along the western
Parnithian foothills remains a major source of trade between Brightmoon and
Lionheart.  Likewise, the northern passes near Lionheart is an important
strategic choke-point connecting Amber to Brightmoon.

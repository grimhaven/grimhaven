  Once patroled by the mighty Calthor Empire, this portion of the Chaos Plains
which lie to the east of the Sedmar River Canyon, were often traveled, hunted
and cultivated.  This changed drastically when the Chaos Winds and its magical 
spawn of creatures destroyed the Calthor Empire.  Now these plains lie barren 
and little traveled or hunted.  Evidence of the once great Empire lie along 
the eastern boundaries of these Plains.

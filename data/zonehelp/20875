  Once populated by farmers, miners and explorers of the Calthor Empire 
these foothills of the Calcathian Mountains, which lie along the eastern 
edge of the Chaos Plains, only marginally escaped total destruction at 
the  hand of the  Chaos Winds.  Now home to refugees and descendants of 
the Calthor Empire these foothills are a dangerous place.  To the few who 
make there home here though these risks are well worth avoiding another 
encounter of the Chaos Winds.

  The Simal Plainsmen are a barbarian tribe of centaur-like creatures, a
cross between an ogre proportioned humanoid and a large feline.  They live
upon the Chaos Plains in one of the numerous pockets of semi-stable magic
areas.  This suits them well as they are able to remain secluded and live
in basic peace, only having to deal with the occasional wandering
abomination from the surrounding plains.

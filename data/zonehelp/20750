  The northern most outpost for the Calthor Empire, it was not spared by 
the Chaos Winds and their passing as the Calthor Empire was destroyed.  
A few of the original scouts which inhabited the Outpost are doomed to 
walk a life of the undead as they eternally man their posts.  Other more 
recent additions  to the inhabitants of the outpost are a small band of 
grungy Orcins, a mishap cross of orc and hobbit.  While not as aggressive 
as their orc-kin, the Orcin are still quite forminable when forced into a 
fight, battling with a fierceness surprising for their small size.

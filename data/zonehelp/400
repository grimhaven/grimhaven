  The world of the upper class spreads far and wide throughout Grimhaven.
Among the chosen include the various shops to the northwest to the hospital
found down eat king's way.  The fortune teller is always a good one to visit
if you are in the neighborhood and even better when you are doing the repairs
that you require.

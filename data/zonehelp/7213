  Lieing far beneath the Obsidian Citadel proper, these mines are the
source of once grand trade that drew civilizations from far and wide to
journey to Citadel.  Now with the Citadel caught in the clutches of the
curse brought on by it's King, the mines run slowly, but still run.  With
few citizens willing to remain in the Citadel, the Overseer of the mines
has resorted to using slave labor to continue his work.  It is said that
the source of the mighty Janasee River begins somewhere in the depths of
the mines.

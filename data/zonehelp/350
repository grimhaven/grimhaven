  This grand palace of Grimhaven can be found both to the east and north of
center square.  Many visitors pass through these halls on a daily basis and
some even stay long enough to wreck the place.  History has it that many great
adventures were started here, and many more might be in future time.  If you
stop by make sure to see the Prince, a fine example of a warrior spirit, while
the Queen can always use a good hello to help her ever present headaches.

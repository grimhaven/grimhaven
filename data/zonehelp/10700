  At the heart of the once grand Obsidian Citadel, the Keep itself is now
a structure filled with ghosts and cursed souls.  Seeking to gain ancient
power, King Urik tried to maintain control over the Obsidian Man unearthed 
within the mines below the Citadel.  His failure brought not only swift
doom for those within the Keep, but lasting doom and downfall to the
entire Citadel.

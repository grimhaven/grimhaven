  Perched high in the Marjiln Mountain range west of the Chaos Plains, and
above the mighty Janasee River, this once grand Citadel was known throughout 
the Realm of Sorrill for its obsidian mines.  Even civilizations in other
lands were known to seek trade with the Citadel for its rare commodities.
Now caught in the clutches of a curse brought on by their King, the
citizens of the Citadel are ruled by a fragile alliance between the
leaders of the Citadel Mage Tower and the Citadel Cathedral.  While the
curse is kept contained within the Citadel's Keep, its horrors still keep
traders from journeying to the Citadel, the main trade route through the
mountains to the east still lieing collapsed and closed.

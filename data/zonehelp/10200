Far to the north, where even the mighty Haon-Dor forests can find no place to
take root amongst the frozen ground, are the vast tundric plains.  It is a
harsh, and forebidding place of permafrost soil and stark emptiness that few
venture into.

The town of Amber maintains a small garrison in the mountains north of the
plains to prevent enemies from the arctic from crossing onto the plains and
sweeping south to the walls of Amber beyond.
